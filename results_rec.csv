1047585820,"UBC - BSc Integrated Science, MSc Rehabilitation Science nan I'm interested in being a clinician-scientist! I'm currently working as a research coordinator as I finished my MSc earlier this year. I am hoping to apply for more schooling to complete more research (PhD) and a health professional degree (I'm debating between MD/DO or RN) I'm loving research and all the opportunities to collaborate with peers and mentors across the country and internationally! I also would love to have more in-person experience as most of my MSc was online due to COVID. :) I applied for UBC, Toronto, Queen's and McGill. I was accepted to McGill, Queen's and UBC, and waitlisted (? or maybe rejected...) to Toronto. I was tempted to move across the country to McGill and Queen's, however, I ultimately decided to stay in Vancouver as I was going through lots of personal change at that time and I wasn't sure if I would thrive if I moved all the way across the country at that time. After my first year, I thought I would major in chemistry or physics, because I really enjoyed first year chem/phys. However, I goofed and pushed back taking term 2 chemistry until the summer and that ruled out a lot of the programs I was eligible to 'major' in. So, I decided to go with Integrated Science. Although there were definitely some challenges (such as getting into laboratory courses - I ended up doing none!), I was able to take advantage of some Integrated Science-specific courses, such as Go Global Seminars and was able to go to Iceland and Hawaii for systems thinking in sustainability courses, which were phenomenal learning experiences. Near the end of my undergraduate degree, I was reflecting on the different involvements and experiences I've had, and realized that research was a huge gap so that really motivated me to pursue an MSc to get the full research experience!   nan Tennis - big fan, playing about 2-3 times/week.

1047567624,"I�m a fourth-year Bachelor of Arts student at UBC, where I study English Literature and History. nan In the future, I'm hoping to become a high school teacher! Growing up, I've always loved reading, and this has definitely led me to the subjects I chose to study at university and the career path I'd like to follow. I was very lucky to have teachers and family members who were kind and supportive of my interests, in addition to being good communicators. When I think back to the positive experiences I had as a younger student, I hope that by becoming a teacher I can learn to guide and support others as my teachers once did for me! I also grew up an only child, so school was a really important place for me to interact with people my age and to make friends, and as I teacher I would want to make my classroom a place where students feel comfortable and safe to do so as well. While studying subjects like English and History might not always be a breeze, I find that I learn best by sharing ideas and telling stories: this is really another reason why I'd like to become a teacher, as I enjoy working with others and I believe I'd learn plenty from my future students, too. I already mentioned my love for reading, but I also love creating and appreciating different types of art. Even though I decided years ago that I wanted to become a high school teacher, I've also always dreamed of working in a creative field as an illustrator, a writer, or even a fashion designer! I'd also love to work at an art gallery or museum someday. In high school, I was interested in lots of different subjects, like visual arts, psychology, history, geography, and literature. I was able to take classes in these subjects in high school and this helped my transition to university because I knew which topics I wanted to explore and I had gotten some transfer credits from Advanced Placement classes. During my time in high school, I also helped out in clubs that were helped promote the arts, which was great because I had the chance to advertise events, help publish students' artwork, and participate in dance performances. Since I was interested in graphic design, photography, and writing, I also helped out with the yearbook and the school newspaper. I find that my experiences in high school helped my communication skills, and I learned that I wished to have a job where I would work with other people. I've lived in the Lower Mainland my whole life, and I remember when I first visited the UBC Vancouver campus as a Grade 8 student when I was participating in a science fair. I remember loving the campus and thinking it was beautiful, and that was definitely one of the reasons why I chose to apply to UBC! I graduated from high school in 2020, and because of the pandemic, I began my studies at UBC completely online. I took a lot of interesting courses, but I really loved what I had read and learned about in my English and History classes, so I chose an English Literature program and a minor in History. As I said before, I'd love to be able to teach these subjects to high school students in the future, so after finishing my undergraduate degree I'd like to enter a teacher education program. nan I've always had plenty of hobbies, and many of them are creative ones! I love reading, drawing, painting, photography, and writing fiction. I have also tried sewing and knitting, too. With my family, I especially enjoy cooking, baking, and gardening. For years, I took dance classes, and my favourite type of dance is ballet. I'm into art and fashion as well, and I can spend whole days window shopping, visiting art galleries, and checking out exhibits at museums.  nan I have an urban background She/Her/Hers nan nan Based on my experiences, I can give advice about studying, joining clubs and participating in extracurricular activities, preparing for university, time management, managing stress and academic struggles, interpersonal relationships, and living on your own. I have experience as a classroom assistant at a high school. Most of the time I helped out in Learning Support Services classrooms, where the environment was relaxed and the teachers and I focused on offering one-on-one support for students who had alternative learning needs, as well as students from various backgrounds, including international students and Indigenous students. I would tutor students in English, Social Studies, French, Career Education, and sometimes Geographical Science or Biology. Even though I helped them with schoolwork, I'd also chat with students about their interests or struggles. I found that we had many things in common, and I've always understood how important it is for teachers to be good listeners and to try to get to know students at an individual level.  nan A little bit more about myself: I was born in the Greater Vancouver area and I have always lived there, and I am East Asian. My parents moved to Canada when they were kids, so I am familiar with different East Asian cultures and I went to school in a diverse area. I can speak French since I was in a French immersion program during elementary school, and I continued to take French classes during high school. nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047583027', 0.95, 'mentor'), ('1047581892', 0.95, 'mentor'), ('1047637319', 0.95, 'mentor'), ('1047582331', 0.94, 'mentor')]"

Although all these careers can make a significant salary, even if money and time were no object I think they would still be my dreams. Growing-up in an Indigenous family has always provided me with unique perspectives on community and healing, which all three of these careers can be centred around. Growing up in a small town I was able to immerse myself in community, connect with individuals who worked in these fields, and further increase my understanding and appreciation for the power of their work. Together this has inspired me to pursue a career where I can have a positive impact on community, specifically through health and social support as these two areas really interest me! Growing up and going through school I was always fascinated by science, and given that my three career aspirations outlined above all required me to start with some form of a bachelors degree, I thought a Bachelors of Science made the most sense. I kept my grades up in high school and applied to universities near my home on Vancouver Island: VIU, UBC, UVIC, and ultimately, when I was accepted to UBC with an entrance scholarship, I decided to accept my offer there.

1047584898,"I recently graduated with my Master of Science in Neuroscience from the University of British Columbia (November 2023). My research focused on the effects of pain and sugar on the hippocampus in premature babies using a mouse model. nan I am interested in careers in health and research, hence why I pursued a master's degree in neuroscience. In the future, I am planning to apply to medical school to become a physician. For me, a physician provides a balance of patient interaction, research, problem solving, and critical thinking that I strive for in a career. In high school, a majority of my courses were science-based as I knew I wanted my career to be in the healthcare field. For my undergraduate degree, I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Biology at UBC. In my last two years of my undergraduate degree, my interests focused mainly on neural systems and the brain, which led me to pursue my masters in neuroscience at UBC. I also volunteered in laboratories and participated in volunteering with Let's Talk Science, a program that provides basic science education to elementary school students in low-income communities. In another lifetime, my dream career would be a baker or cake decorator, as silly as it may sound. I love to bake and do food-based art, so if I could make these hobbies into a career, I would absolutely do it at a different stage of my life! At the moment, I am working as a clinical research coordinator at BC Cancer Agency and I really love that my job is a combination of healthcare, education, research, communication with physicians, radiation therapists, nurses, and patients all in one! I also get to do some cancer tissue processing, which provides more depth to the role.  When I began my undergraduate degree at UBC, I started my Bachelor of Science (BSc) program immediately after high school. Second year of my BSc was when students decided their majors; we ranked our top 3 choices, to which I chose: 1) Integrated Science, 2) Biology, and 3) Microbiology & Immunology. Integrated science was my first choice because the program was a lot more flexible in terms of courses you could choose compared to Biology and allowed students to more narrowly pursue their science-based interests. Unfortunately, I did not achieve my top choice in major. Instead, I got accepted into Biology, my second choice. Although the outcome was initially a blow to my confidence, I continued to pursue Biology courses and in years 3 and 4, I really loved my major and was able to take a lot of lab-based experience I gained from my undergraduate degree into my masters program. I graduated with my Bachelor of Science with a major in Biology in 2020, then immediately began my Masters of Science in Neuroscience program in 2020, which I completed in 2023.  nan My hobbies include baking, watching TikToks, and learning about space and the universe. Baking has been an activity I've enjoyed doing for years. One of my favourite recipes to make is a chocolate lava cake, which requires only a handful of ingredients and is very quick to complete. I can even share the recipe if you're interested! I'm currently planning to learn how to make coffee cake with an espresso buttercream frosting. My sister is also passionate about baking and makes the most amazing coffee cake, so I am trying to perfect her recipe for myself. Spending long periods of time on TikTok is also something I enjoy. I love being able to lay in bed and scroll through videos for hours - it�s my definition of relaxation haha. Recently, I've become very interested in astronomy, galaxies, and various planets across the universe. I've recently learned a bit about nebulae and rogue planets, and I'm trying to learn more about the physics of black holes. If you have any space knowledge you'd like to share or resources that could teach me more, I'd love to hear it! nan I have an urban background She/her. I am creative, ambitious, disciplined, and detail-oriented. I am also friendly, approachable, and compassionate. nan My main goal is to help students with their transition into post-secondary, specifically with work-life balance, working while in school, time-management and prioritization, and good habits to form before and during post-secondary. Furthermore, I want to help students who may struggle academically, especially as the workload in university is very different to the workload in highschool, and how to overcome those challenges. Being South Asian with a tight-knit family, I can also help with how to maintain boundaries with family members and seeking independence and autonomy while in post-secondary. nan I am a South Asian (Bangaldeshi) woman born and raised in Burnaby, British Columbia. Family ties are a major component of our culture and it is expected that we follow all guidance and advice from our parents in every aspect of our future, regardless of whether their advice aligns with our goals. Being part of a collectivist community such as Bangladesh has presented significant challenges in gaining individuality and autonomy over the choices in my life, relationships, and career goals, and it took a lot of trial and error to become my true, authentic, and autonomous self in the face of my parents' wishes. Although my family provides strong support and love for me, being able to dismember myself from their expectations of my future and holding my ground on my dreams and future path has been challenging, but extremely rewarding. For youth who are stuck in the crosshairs of appeasing their family's wishes but wanting to pursue their own goals, it's an experience I have plenty of stories on, and I am proud to stay that over the years, I've gained true autonomy of my life, relationships, and future while maintaining strong familial and community ties.  nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047581892', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047637319', 0.96, 'mentor'), ('1047585820', 0.95, 'mentor'), ('1047583027', 0.95, 'mentor')]"

1047582596,"I have attended CNC and UNBC. Always in the psychology program but added English And First Nations studies. nan I am currently designing a non-profit program that will bring free drop in counselling to my community and utilize Western and First Nation methods to mental health and spiritual well being.I am also currently writing an auto-fiction manuscript on harm reduction recovery. This self help book will incorporate my experiences, journey of personal growth and several fields of psychology offering the reader the tools they need to recover from a combination of trauma, mental illness and addiction.Although my life has not been easy, or ideal, it is the reason I have these goals today.  Honestly since I was a high school drop out, single mother and recovering addict I did not believe post secondary school was an option for me. I grew up in rural areas and in poverty, even graduating high school hadn't seemed like an option for me as I started working and was on my own very young.When I first thought about more schooling I didn't aim very high academically. I had been cooking since I was seven and so I got my GED and did Culinary Arts Levels 1 & 2 at CNC. I wasn't the best in the class but I passed and my ginger bread clock tower was celebrated. Being exposed to the college experience really got me thinking about what I had wanted to do as a child. I wanted to be a Psychologist and help people.I grew bored cooking for a living quickly and was working as a support worker with people in addiction. I found myself thinking why not? after all I survived addiction and Culinary Arts. Why not me? Why can I not achieve my dreams? So I booked an appointment with an academic advisor at CNC.The list of things I had to do was huge... placement tests, upgrading and then a huge list of classes for the psychology program. I couldn't say or spell many of the words on my to do list. Some of them I didn't even know the meaning of! I still spelt psychology wrong sometimes! It was anxiety provoking but I put my negative self talk away, ignored all of the things I believed growing up and took a chance on myself. After a placement test I decided that if I could pass the first step, the first class, I would keep going and I did. One task at a time.I completed my upgrading at CNC (repeating each math class twice), and I took first year classes while I was upgrading. By the time I was in second year classes I had been diagnosed with ADHD GAD PTSD and Bi-polar disorder. I learned how to accept and ask for help with the staff at CNC. I finished my upgrading and the classes offered at CNC before transferring to UNBC.At UNBC I utilized everything I knew from my experiences at CNC. I added English and First Nations studies to my Bachelors degree in the form of minors for a diverse degree. It was at UNBC that I finished the upper level classes of my degree and gained the confidence I need for my current passion projects.I graduated from UNBC with a Bachelors Degree in the Science of Psychology with minors in English and First Nations studies and a 3.21 GPA. Some days it still feels unbelievable because I never allowed myself to think this far ahead. I would get overwhelmed thinking about all of the classes I had to take and only focus on one semester at a time. Finishing my biggest goals in life has given me the opportunity and knowledge I need to make and achieve the new ones.   nan I have various hobbies; cooking, baking, gardening, hiking, writing, going to the range, entertaining, game nights, working out, cats and dogs, DIY projects and most recently a bit of web design.  nan I have a rural background her, she  0 nan I have experience working with people struggling with addiction and/or mental illness.I also am one of these people.I have had to learn how to overcome many barriers to mange my disabilities both personally and academically. Leaving a rural area for an urban setting is something I did as a minor and then again and an adult with different outcomes. I have utilized all of my post secondary knowledge into my daily living for things like time management, motivation and  overcoming specific obstacles.  nan I have one First Nation ancestor aways back in our family tree. Current DNA testing doesn't have a measure for FN ancestry. I acknowledge both my ancestor and 23andMe DNA testing. My test confirmed that I am a combination of four different types of Caucasian with a hint of North African and a pinch of unidentifiable DNA.Race is a social construct and so if my skin is light I am perceived as a 'white' woman. However if I get too much sun in the summer I encounter a range of racism. From staff at institutions asking my band, to implying negative stereo types about Indigenous women and mothers.

1047634577,"I am studying anthropology (a social science) and I�m in my fourth year at UBC. Anthropology is just the study of why humans do the things they do. I went to UBC straight from high school. nan I�m not really sure what I want to do since a lot of what I�m interested in won�t make enough money to live well on but are important in society anyways. A lot of what interests me are in the social services such as working for a non�profit or charity, city planning, being a librarian or a teacher, working with communities in Chinatown etc. My dream careers are to be an author, to open up a bookstore/caf�, or something in the arts/fashion fields. Ever since I could read, I wanted to be a writer, but this wasn�t something my family/community could accept. I am Chinese with immigrant parents so the stereotype is to be a doctor, lawyer or engineer LOL and I absolutely did not want to do that. I thought I was bad at science and math and I really liked to read and write, so that kind of influenced what I wanted to study at university. Of course, I guess what I studied at university ended up influencing what I want to have a job in. Being Chinese Canadian and with immigrant parents, who were a bit stereotypical lol, I went into university straight from high school with no gap years and this was during the pandemic in 2020. I applied to two schools, all local since my parents wanted me to stay close, and I got into both. I chose UBC because, one I really liked the campus and it was higher in prestige, and two my parents probably wouldn�t have liked me going to SFU as much as UBC (and I honestly would�ve have felt the same too). I did switch majors. Originally, I wanted English, but my parents were not too happy about that. I also wanted First Nations and Indigenous studies, but my parents also thought that was too narrow. I did have a minor in Urban Studies but I dropped that to do my own research project in anthropology on outdoor sportswear and why Chinese people in Vancouver wear this type of style. I like anthropology because the readings are more specific and in depth about peoples� lives or situations. If I was better at doing my homework, I probably would have done something related to food or farming since I really enjoyed farming in my summers with an urban farming summer camp in the city. To this day, I think my parents still don�t know why I chose anthropology and what I�m going to do with this degree. A lot of my university journey was about balancing what my parents were worried about (job security, difficulty of program, its prestige etc) with what I wanted nan My main hobby is reading the internet. I�m on reddit a lot and my favourite places to browse are pop culture chat/faux moi, cooking/recipes/food, the ubc subreddit, starbucks, lushcosmetics, makeupaddiction/rehab and more. If I had the attention span to read, I�d do that, but I�m mostly scrolling through Instagram these days. I also like baking/cooking and I love watching food content on youtube. It�s a bit harder living alone to buy flour and other ingredients, so I don�t do it as much. I also love hiking when I can, which is never since I procrastinate and I don�t drive. I love the outdoors but didn�t have much opportunity to do much outdoors stuff. I also started embroidery but I�m sooooo bad at it right now. The main issue is time with school and life stuff like cooking, grocery shopping, laundry etc. takes up a lot of brain energy so I don�t often end up doing my hobbies. But yeah, those are my hobbies nan I have an urban background she/they, either or works as well as interchanged. A lot of how my personality works is from my culture, being Chinese Canadian. I had a lot of identity issues growing up since I didn�t really fit in with the stereotypes that a lot of my peers somehow ended up fitting in to. I�m shy and I don�t like talking to people, which made the transition to university and living alone very hard. I�m also not really close to my family, until much recently, since I had some struggles with mental health (anxiety and just a lot of sadness throughout my teens) that my parents didn�t really understand. My sister also did really well in school and continues to do well, while I can�t be bothered to even start my homework earlier now� Generally, if you don�t do well in school, talk back to your elders when they�re sexist, racist etc, have messy handwriting, don�t want to do the typical �Asian� activities, you�re viewed as a problem and/or just really weird. Obviously, not all Chinese Canadian people are like that, but this was (is?) something that I faced� And not fitting in, well, that�s a big thing for me now. I used to feel like I had to prove that I was Chinese to others, but now, I don�t. I also used to feel like I wasn�t enough unless I could get the academic scholarships or be top of my class. It sounds almost ridiculous as I still did really well in high school and uni, and a lot of people would love my grades lol. I�m also queer, which I think my parents don�t always understand or even want to accept. I didn�t find out about this aspect of my life until grade 9 when I joined the LGBTQ+ club lmao. Being queer helps me understand that I don�t often live/work/exist in binaries nor �boxes.� There�s a flexibility in life that I�ve come to find after realizing this aspect of me. I developed more confidence moving away and having to actually ask for help or interact with people helped with my social anxiety. nan Hmm� I think I�d be able to help with exploring identity, and finding ways to view oneself beyond school/grades/geographic location/situation etc as I�ve had to discover who I was beyond my academic performance. In addition, I did have to learn how to adult like doing laundry, grocery shopping, finding time for hobbies, going to the doctor etc. so I�d also be able to help with those topics. While I don�t have a disability, but I am a bit familiar with disability resources at universities as well as what support one can access for mental health. Also down to talk about just general mental health/parent/immigrant/being a POC/being Asian, Chinese experiences as well. I worked two holidays at Lush (the bathbomb store) and it was very very fun. I also volunteered at a thrift store, and at community centres for spring break programs. nan I'm a virgo if you're into horoscopes. My MBTI is INFP if that also helps (I don't believe in this as much). I don't usually mention this, but I do sometimes listen to K-pop, and have watched some anime.

I love hosting people but also would love the ability to have a more self-sustained lifestyle with some animals and a garden. Originally, I applied to a few universities to their educational faculty as I wanted to be a science teacher. I found it hard to imagine very many different careers with science as I hadn't been exposed to any of them. After speaking to my high school career councilor, she suggested I apply for engineer instead and see where that would take me. My first year of engineering was challenging making the leap to university from high school but at UBC (and most engineering schools in Canada), you do a general year and then pick your specialty from there. I think that extra year to explore different types of engineering really helped me as I had never heard of most types of engineering that UBC offered. nan I have been playing rugby since I was 13 and I found that it really helped my transition to the city for university when I was able to find a team to play for in Vancouver and make friends outside of school.In my spare time at home I bake cookies, banana bread and have recently been attempting different kinds of bread.

In another life, I think being a professional skydiver sounds interesting. While originally from Kelowna, I wanted to go to school in Vancouver to experience living on my own in a bigger city. I wanted to be a doctor and always loved biology, so biochemistry or microbiology seemed like the obvious choice. In first year, I enrolled in a smaller program called Science One, in hopes of having a stronger online community during zoom school. The program takes an interdisciplinary approach to the sciences, focusing on the intersections between fields. Ultimately this program and its wonderful professors helped me realize I actually love physics, which I had easily written off as my least favourite subject in high school.

1047582593,"University of Waterloo Math/Science Double major. Minor in Economics, Computer Science, Business. (Specialization in Bioinformatics). University of Victoria Law 2nd year  nan I will start with my most practical and realistic career goal since I am actively pursing that at the moment:- Working on public policy especially in areas relating to health, privacy, and information technology- Starting my own company developing legal technology to improve access to justice- High school teacher a bit later down the roadWhy?: ""Jack of all trades, master of none"" (at least not yet, working on it). I have found that that sentence really captures my background. The wider the breadth of your knowledge, the more you begin to notice the similarities between vastly different subjects. For example, researchers in the sciences trying to figure out a specific pathway to a biological phenomenon is not that much different from a detective trying to solve a crime. So this really culminates in my choosing of a career that could best leverage my academic background. And it turns out that public policy in healthcare, IT, involves legal and business considerations, as well as technical knowledge of which I learned about in university.Solving access to justice issues, or being a teacher is also just me trying to leverage my knowledge and expertise to become involved in a field that I care about. I think there is a lot of inefficiencies when it comes to public administration and access to justice, which makes the system that much less fair than it should be. And it makes a world of difference between a 'teacher' versus someone who is fun, passionate, and tailors the material to the class.And if I had no time constraint:- Data Scientist/Bioinformatician. Preferrably on research in personalized medicine and genetics- Legal advisor for NGO (environmental or humanitarian issues)A bit contrived, but I do want to 'make a difference' aha. And I think biopharma, climate change, and geopolitical stability are some of the most fundamental issues.Show me the money careers:- eSports/Sports owner or manager- Principal of my own school or university- Youtuber (travel, DIY, philanthropy)  Full disclosure, I aced my high school in almost every subject, and I did it without sacrificing much time outside or with friends or extracurricular activities (so not in a, dare I say it, 'nerd' way). First year university was tough because I went out of province and I didn't know anyone. Then came the second year of university, and I failed. I was given an opportunity to try again. I failed, again. I hid that fact from my parents for an entire year but eventually they did find out. And I'm not sure if you are aware of the Asian family dynamic, but it was a huuuge deal. I had never failed in anything before in my entire life and then when it mattered, I was basically kicked out of my program. But my parents were supportive, and after some really awkward and uncomfortable dinners, we got through it. I reevaluated my options and switched programs, and did very well afterwards. I ended up spending more time in uni than I would have liked, but looking back I have no regrets. I can probably spend hours going into details on my university path, but my most important takeaway is, some of your most painful failures can become some of your most valued and solid foundations going forward. And I hope the lessons I learned from my ordeal can help better prepare you in your future. nan Games: Moba (only fun with friends ha); some RTS, RPG, shooters.

I am also well equipped to answer any program specific questions on areas of study, academic advice, majors and colleges etc.I have had relatively significant professional experiences through work study, internship, and co-op, so I can answer questions such as what it is like working in the government, or in a startup, or overseas etc. I would also hopefully be able to direct them towards relevant resources where they would be able to explore more in depth. nan I welcome all types of questions or concerns about life post secondary school. Also, I am in my 2nd year law school so I can answer many questions related to this path of study as well. nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047585820', 0.95, 'mentor'), ('1047584898', 0.95, 'mentor'), ('1047583027', 0.94, 'mentor'), ('1047637319', 0.94, 'mentor')]"

The insight and knowledge would be so valuable.  nan Right out of highschool I took my first year of college in Salmon arm. After that, I took a U turn went to Blanche MacDonald, a beauty school! It was a one year program where I thought I would be a medical esthetician and work with people to improve their skin, etc. Well, turns out I hated it, and really struggled in Vancouver, so I dropped out half way through... I was so busy working to pay for my lifestyle, and I wasn't passionate about school..I was working at a pub with long hours, and created a lifestyle that wasn't productive or positive, I think that factored into my decision too. I was 19!   Anyways, I look back and really wish I stuck with it (despite not having an interest) because having that certification may of served me in my future. I managed a establishment in Gastown, Vancouver for 2 years after that, then transferred to Calgary to try and build my career with the establishment. Worked as a marketing and communications manager for Stampede tents, hated it! And it reiterated my passion for social work and mental health, so while working there I started taking online courses. After that, moved back to Kamloops and transferred into the BSW program. I've been working as a vocational counsellor for people with disabilities while completing my degree in Kamloops.

I found that while I was in high school, there were certain teachers who really made my experience the best that it could be, and I want to return that gesture for my own future students. I�m also considering a career in the psychology field or obtaining a Masters degree in Library Science - I�ve taken many undergraduate psychology courses which I found super interesting and would love working in that area, and this past year I worked at a library on-campus that I really enjoyed and could also foresee a career in for myself. My path to post-secondary is a bit of a complicated one. In Grade 12, I had my entire life planned out, from each course I would take in every year in my undergrad to which medical schools I would apply to. I was 100% set on becoming a doctor, and my dream school was McMaster University in their Health Sciences program. My plan was thrown off when I received a rejection letter from them, and so I accepted the school that I had listed as my second choice: the University of Waterloo, where I studied Honours Health Studies. I quickly found that medical school wasn�t the right path for me because I wasn�t passionate about any of my health-related classes, and so I started to think more about what I really cared about rather than what I thought I 'should' do. I�ve always had a strong love for animals, and so I decided to make the move across the country to study Applied Animal Biology at the University of British Columbia (UBC), which I am in the process of completing this year. I chose to study at UBC because it was one of the only schools in Canada that offered an animal biology program that aligned with my interests. Throughout the past three years, I�ve thought about pursuing veterinary science, working in a zoo or a conservation area, or finding a career in an animal shelter. I�ve finally settled on something almost unrelated to my degree - teaching. Its been quite the journey with a lot of difficult moments, but without these hardships I never would have found where my true passions lie! nan I love to play video games, watch anime/read manga, and play piano in my free time!
