1047644182,"I'm in my 3rd year in Cinema Studies at UBC. I switched the program from UBC Forestry to Arts because I initially didn't get admitted to Arts. nan My dream career would be to work in film direction or screenwriting, where I could bring stories to life and reach a global audience. I'm always inspired and amazed by the film worlds where the audience and the artists' imaginations are free and unlimited. However, understanding the challenges of the film industry, especially as an international student, I am also considering a career in education. I believe that education is another powerful platform for impact and change. I can use my background in film to create engaging, multimedia educational content, potentially transforming traditional educational environments. I was initially admitted to the Forestry program at UBC. However, my passion lies in the arts, specifically film studies, which is my first choice field. I decided to enroll in the Forestry program during my first year while preparing to switch to the Arts department in my second year. In pursuing my passion for film and the arts, I made a bold decision to enroll exclusively in arts and film-related courses. This choice came with significant risks. Not taking any forestry-related courses meant that I could be suspended from the university if I did not meet the strict requirements for transferring programs. Luckily, I gained fair marks on all my first-year courses and successfully transferred to the Arts department. I learned that it's okay if things don't work out as planned, so it marks the importance of preparing a backup plan as early as possible. Sometimes, following your heart requires taking calculated risks, and setbacks can be pivotal learning opportunities. nan gaming, watching Netfilx and YouTube (I love watching vlogs), musicals, cooking, 3D modelling (I'm still self-learning this) nan I have an urban background She/her One of my defining characteristics is my passion for languages and cultures, which has significantly shaped who I am today. I am fluent in Mandarin, my mother tongue, and English, which I have honed through living and studying in Canada since secondary school. Additionally, my love for K-dramas inspired me to learn Korean. I took some basic French classes a few years ago and am currently studying Cantonese. My multilingual capability has enriched my perspectives, allowing me to connect with people from various backgrounds more deeply and meaningfully. nan Having navigated the challenges of living independently in a new country from a young age, I can offer practical advice on managing daily responsibilities and making a home feel like a safe, personal space. I understand the feelings of loneliness and homesickness that can come with moving away from family and familiar surroundings. I can share strategies to build a supportive network, engage in community activities, and find hobbies that keep one connected and fulfilled. I can be a listening ear and offer insights on managing negative feelings. nan I want my mentee to know that I am here not just to guide but to learn as well. I view mentoring as a two-way street where both mentor and mentee grow and learn from each other. I am excited about the possibility of forming a meaningful and impactful mentoring relationship. nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047637319', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047551740', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047627114', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047567941', 0.97, 'mentor')]"

1047643228,"I am third year Bachelor of Science, biology major at University of the Fraser Valley in Abbotsford BC. I will be starting my fourth and last academic year at UFV in September 2024 ! nan My long term goal is to be professor and short term is to get into a biotechnology or biopharmaceutical company once I graduate. I feel that teaching is in my blood - both my parents were teachers. But I am the only 'bio' person in my family !!! My mom was a math teacher and my dad taught economics and math. But guess what ! like every biologist (may be most) I hate math lol !! I don't know since what point in my live did I start to fall in love with biology and human body. I love studying about it and I can talk hours and hours about it - sometimes my family and friends get tired of listening to my scientific stuff !!! But I love what I am studying and hope to be successful in this field some day.  Although I have not attended more than one post-secondary school, but I did take admission in one and dropped after a month! It was during covid, I was in India. I took admission in an Honors program (which is like harder version of what people normally take in university) at university which was well known for its microbiology department in the whole northern region of my country. Admission into this program is highly competitive, I was happy I got in. BUT ! I was NOT enjoying the whole online thing !!! I used to have thirst for that subject, I LOVED it - but now it sucked ! So instead of wasting more of my time, I decided to do something about it. My family suggested me pursuing my study in Canada, also my grandparents lived here so they wanted me to stay with them. So I studied math for a year since it was pre-requisite for admission at UFV. Completed grade 11 math, grade 12 math and took English language test- all in less than a year !! FINALLY, in september 2021 I attended my first class as a biology major at UFV in Canada.  nan I love to paint - although I have become a little lazy in picking up the brush and palette nowadays. I have my paintings hanging on my staircase wall and I am so proud of myself everytime I see them. Nowadays I enjoy watching korean dramas and listening to korean pop songs - I am huge BTS fan !!!! I hope I have enough money in future to travel to different places in the world and staying in luxury hotels. Oh and did I tell you that I LOVE Dubai ?! I once had a long flight layover there and I am mesmerized and awstruck since that day !!!  nan I have a rural background she I lost my mom and younger brother in a car accident when I was in eighth grade. Since that day I am a different person. I started to value my relationships over anything else. I used to be a book-worm, missing out on most family functions, skipping hanging out with friends. But now I value my family more than anything in the world ! I have understood how uncertain tomorrow can be. It is important to grab every opportunity to make memories with your loved ones. Ok! Not more emotional stuff ! I am passionate about biology - ask me a fun biology fact and I would always have one to tell ! I hope I can make my mentee fall in love with this subject - that would be a success for me ! nan I am the eldest among kids in both maternal and paternal sides of my family. I am the go-to person for advices related to relationships, regarding convincing parents in a logical manner, for careers not relating to biology, for fashion , makeup and every other topic you can find! Since I was the first one among kids in my family to go through modern peer-pressure, overcome cultural barrier at university, pursue a career on one else in family did, I am usually good at advising them. Advising my mentee would be just like advising my cousins. I would listen actively to their thoughts, concerns and aspirations without judgement.  nan If I have to define myself in bunch of words or phrases, these would be: cultural, passionate about biology, value family relationships, respect my teachers and admire them a lot, painting, wish to leave my imprint on world of biology which would help humanity before I leave this world nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047567532', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047633468', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047582923', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047627111', 0.96, 'mentor')]"

1047641572,"University of British Columbia Okanagan, program: biology, year: 3 nan I�m somebody that loves working in labs and working with various types of lab equipment. I like a mobile job and not a full-time desk job. I�m hoping to go to grad school for a masters in immunology because I love learning about diseases and medicine in relation to the human body. I did get into the program of my choice at my first choice of school but just not the campus I wanted. I am in the same program as when I first started. I wouldn�t call myself the conventional student, because I struggled a lot to understand my capabilities in university. I had my failures, disappointments and moments of changing my major. However, science, particularly biology, was my passion. I might not be the smartest person, but I work hard to improve and do better each time. I will be taking a bit longer to graduate due to taking it at a slower pace that is more manageable for me, but I�m hoping to learn and gain new experiences in that extra time. nan I�m a very artistic person at heart. I love drawing, particularly sketching, painting and using different types of art mediums. I love doing origami, and making clay models and structures. I trained as a classical pianist for 5 years and I use music as an outlet to relax. I love crocheting and making cool tops, plushies and bags. I love watching thriller documentaries, movies and shows. I love reading when I have the time to (genres like romance, historical fiction and fantasy). I love playing badminton and going for occasional walks on a nice day. I do also workout a couple days in the week. nan I have an urban background she I�m a very slow learner. This is a fault I came to realize late in life, and it is something I�m still continuing to work around. I have to put in more work than the average student to understand something. So when you�re in a STEM related field this can be very discouraging because you�re surrounded by really smart students. However, I�m willing to put all my effort into achieving my dream even if it might take me a bit longer than the average person. I�m proud of my ability to stay optimistic despite all the hardships I face. nan I�m someone that struggles with mental health, and I come from a background where mental health is not prioritized as much as it should be. I went through a lot of ups and downs when I first started university (both personally and academically). It�s important to prioritize both your mental/physical health and your work and other priorities in life. This is one essential topic that I would like to touch base on with my mentee. Also, managing on your own if you live away from your family. I found it hard to adjust in the beginning with cooking for myself, cleaning up after myself and managing it all while attending classes. Some days will be a struggle, and it�s okay to feel lazy and unmotivated at times. nan I�m a very open-minded person, and a good listener.

1047640464,"I attended UBC Okanagan and graduated in 2021 with a BSc majoring in Psychology. I am now in my third year of medical school at the Southern Medical Program (UBC Medicine) in Kelowna.  nan I am interested in many careers within medicine. Currently I am pursuing a career as a family doctor, and hope to get extra training as an emergency doctor. If time was not a factor, I would maybe consider becoming a neurosurgeon or neurologist because I always found the science of neurology really cool and like working with my hands, but the long process to getting there is daunting and since I also love family medicine I am going to choose that route as it is much less time-consuming. I considered at times becoming a science teacher if medicine didn't work out. There wasn't anything in particular that pushed me towards wanting to pursue medicine, it was just something I was always interested in since I was young. Nothing caught my attention in school like physiology or anatomy did.  During highschool, I knew I wanted to be a doctor but I had very little understanding of the pathway to get there. I just knew that I had to pursue some type of undergraduate degree first. Because I knew I loved science, I applied to a bachelor of science degree at UBCO and got in. I ended up deferring for one year because I wanted to experience more of the world first and ended up taking a cool volunteer position at the Baha'i World Center in Israel as a security guard/tour guide and was there for one year. Throughout my undergrad, I took all the science courses that I was interested in and ended up finding that I really loved to learn about psychology as I found it was becoming more and more relevant of a topic in society. I ended up majoring in it and it really helped me in my patient interactions in medical school.  nan My hobbies include fishing, soccer, snowboarding, longboarding, playing guitar/drums/piano, creating and editing videos, playing Fortnite and Call of Duty on Xbox, hiking, and playing board games. I recently got more into cooking and like making cool soups.  nan I have an urban background he/him I'm typically a very outgoing person, and have a strong desire to experience every possible thing that life has to offer. I love trying new things and will typically order the most outrageous item I can find on the menu at restaurants. I've always been passionate about social change and helping others and that's why I was became a community youth group facilitator for ages 11-14 for the past 10 years. In this group, we help them organize community service projects, organize team sports, and go through reading materials that help develop powers of expression. I found that the year I spent volunteering in Israel after highschool was a life-changing experience because I lived and worked with volunteers from all around the globe, from villages in Uganda to large cities in China. For that reason that year felt almost like I had travelled the world and gotten a taste for many different cultures. Because I am so interested in pursuing new opportunities, I frequently jump from one hobby to another and find that because of this I am able to relate to a large diversity of people and usually will share at least one hobby or interest in common with them.  nan I think I could help my mentee by providing examples of how one can live their life in a coherent way and not become too tunnel-visioned on a single goal. I worked three jobs throughout highschool and developed strategies to keep my grades up.

Being from a smaller area with family members who chose not to attend post-secondary, I'd love to be an example and make them proud! I was inspired and pushed by my teachers in high school as they showed great encouragement when it came to me deciding my future goals. I had originally started with hopes of obtaining a chemical engineer degree, then turned to a animal health (vet), and eventually found my passion for the brain! I was accepted into my first choice school and program, and also accepted when I switched paths. Although accepted into university straight from higshchool, I ended up taking a gap year between. And I am currently taking another gap year between my undergrad and medical school to beef up my volunteering and traveling/enjoying life! Although difficult, I worked my way through uni, trying to avoid loans as much as possible but of course it doesn't always work out that way because of bills. So I did take some minimal loans, learned to live on my own, learned to budget and meal prep and balance a work-school schedule. nan I love my pets! Lots of cuddling with my cats and dogs. I had a farm back home and enjoy horseback riding so much! I do love hunting, fishing, quaking, camping, swimming in the lakes and rivers (and ocean when im home). But now that I am in the city I chose more urban hobbies like pottery, working out, art classes, farmer's markets, painting, drawing, and of course reading! I love walks or hikes, doing charcuterie boards with friends, etc... nan I have a rural background she/her I am organized and very meticulous, but sometimes these can be faults because I take my time because of perfectionism/anxiety! I am a bit shy, sometimes feel some imposter syndrome especially now that I am a graduate. But I am dedicated, very passionate for learning, work really hard in my jobs and school. I love academic validation, I do believe in physical health relating to your mental health! I am the first child in my family to attend university, coming from a poverish background and trying to pay/figure out university on my own! I have yet to leave canada but have made it a huge importance for my year off! nan Moving from rural to urban, finding motivation, self discipline, time management, adulting (although I still often feel like a child).

1047637319,"I am in my second year of a Bachelor's of Science degree at UBC Vancouver studying Neuroscience, with an intended minor in Indigenous Studies. nan Following university there are three careers that I am primarily interested in at this point: Social Work, Nursing, or Medicine. Although all these careers can make a significant salary, even if money and time were no object I think they would still be my dreams. Growing-up in an Indigenous family has always provided me with unique perspectives on community and healing, which all three of these careers can be centred around. Growing up in a small town I was able to immerse myself in community, connect with individuals who worked in these fields, and further increase my understanding and appreciation for the power of their work. Together this has inspired me to pursue a career where I can have a positive impact on community, specifically through health and social support as these two areas really interest me! Growing up and going through school I was always fascinated by science, and given that my three career aspirations outlined above all required me to start with some form of a bachelors degree, I thought a Bachelors of Science made the most sense. I kept my grades up in high school and applied to universities near my home on Vancouver Island: VIU, UBC, UVIC, and ultimately, when I was accepted to UBC with an entrance scholarship, I decided to accept my offer there. Originally, I planed to major in chemistry, but after first year I found myself feeling like I was lacking roundedness in my education -- I missed learning social sciences, hummanities, and biology, so I decided to switch my major to Neuroscience and pursue a minor in Indigenous studies. nan watching movies, baking, cooking, swimming, reading, painting, ceramics, hiking, beading, making playlists/music on garageband, board games, running, fashion design, gardening, watching hockey, playing volleyball, creative writing, singing nan I have a rural background he/him I'm very passionate about Indigenous social issues and decolonilization, I'm a first generation university student, I have navigated loss of close family members, I belong to the LGBTQ community, I am proudly Cree-M�tis, I have travelled to 12 different countries, I do truly love helping others; I have a parent and sibling with dyslexia and have helped them navigate this disability, I really value creating community and community connection, I love taking leadership positions and supporting others in pursuing leadership roles! nan I have experienced moving to large city and living in a variety of housing situations (dorms, apartments, shared housing), I have independently dealt with finances of post-secondary education/independent living, I have volunteer experience as an educational tutor (2 years) for Indigenous elementary and high school students, I was involved in a First Nations fitness program, I have worked as a lifeguard and swim instructor for almost four years, I worked as an art instructor for 1.5 years and worked with newly immigrated Canadians, people with ADHD, ASD, social anxiety nan I am indigenous and LGBTQ and happy to talk about my experiences (positive and negative) relating to these identities in my rural and urban community living experiences nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047587166', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047644182', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047627114', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047551740', 0.97, 'mentor')]"

However, I always had a lot of difficulty deciding what in science I wanted to do especially throughout high school. Even in my first year of post-secondary, I had a lot of hesitation towards what I wanted to do in the future. After a lot of consideration towards my direction and taking more classes in post-secondary, I saw myself going into the pharmaceutical sciences path which led to my interest towards pharmacy and ultimately applying for pharmacy school. I started in Science at UBC in first year where I decided on the major, Microbiology and Immunology in my second year of post-secondary. Then in my third year of post-secondary, I transitioned into pharmacy school in the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences. UBC Science was my first-choice program and school.

1047637199,"Kinesiology at University of British Columbia (UBC), second year undergraduate student nan In the future, I hope to pursue a career in healthcare and as of right now, my ultimate goal is to get into medical school. However, I am not 100% sure if this is the right path for me (and that is totally ok, if you are also in the same boat!). Right now, I am using my undergraduate years as an opportunity to work/volunteer in my community and with different age groups and trying to keep an open mind to new experiences. Some other paths I am considering are doing a master's in Kinesiology (sports science), and getting involved in research, or pursuing physiotherapy or occupational therapy. I am also interested in teaching, specifically teaching elementary or high school. In the past, I have worked as a lifeguard and swim instructor, volunteered at sports camps with individuals with intellectual and physical disabilities, worked in an exercise lab with seniors, and led a first aid club in my high school and these experiences have fueled my passion for the potential career paths I'm currently exploring. Until the end of grade 11, my plan was to apply to a Science program at a BC university, mainly because it was the path most of my family members and my older sibling followed. However, during high school, a friend introduced me to Kinesiology. As a former high school athlete involved in soccer, track and field, swimming, and ice skating, this intrigued me and in my final year, I rearranged my schedule to take the prerequisite courses for this program. This goes to show that even in grade 12, changing your mind about your degree path is possible! I applied to 7 schools across Canada and received positive responses from all of them, including my first-choice program (Kinesiology) at UBC. I decided to attend UBC for my undergrad to stay closer to my family. nan I have a huge sweet tooth so for fun I love to bake. In the past, I have baked cookies, cakes, and muffins, and also once attempted to make cake pops but it didn't go very well and I just ended up with questionable circle-shaped cake pops (I don�t even know if I can e say they were circles with all the cracks on them) and a bunch of melted icing on the kitchen counter ??. I also enjoy playing sports, such as soccer, swimming, and skating, I like to do weight lifting and love to hike outdoors when the weather is nice. I also love shopping so I always treat myself to a shopping/eating day after my final exams (it is the only thing that keeps me motivated to study ??). I always also enjoy spending time with family and friends, whether it is through movie nights, going to a restaurant or having a bowling night! nan I have an urban background she/her I immigrated to Canada from Iran in grade 7 and being a shy person, it was not easy for me to talk to new people. Over the past years, I have been able to find my place in my community by engaging in activities that interest me whether it's through sports, volunteering/working, or engaging in creative activities and I think these opportunities have definitely helped build my confidence and become a more outgoing person. Moreover, I found my passion for health/fitness during the pandemic when I began to focus more on my mental and physical well-being. I learned that health is not just about occasional workouts or diets, but it's a lifestyle that integrates movement, nutrition, and mental balance. As a student studying Kinesiology, I hope to promote the idea that true health stems from consistent, holistic practices that nurture both the body and the mind. nan Beyond career and education, I'm here to help with essential life skills.

1047636818,"I previously attended UVic for 3 years, where I studied Kinesiology. Currently, I attend UBC, where I am in my first year of the PharmD program to become a pharmacist. I have been in post-secondary school for 4 years. nan Right now, I am most interested in becoming a pharmacist. I think I will really enjoy this career as I am interested in it from a content perspective, but also because it allows me to use the talent and skills I have in a way that serves others. Furthermore, I loved working in a pharmacy as an assistant, and I thought the pharmacist had such a neat job. In the future, I hope to either open my own store, or be employed in a clinical setting, such as a hospital. However, in a vacuum where there are no other external factors, I would have considered being a chemist. I enjoyed my chemistry classes so much at UVic and I scored quite well in my classes. I also considered going into medicine, but it turned out to not be the best fit. My path to get to university was quite standard. Both of my parents attended university, and I always tried my hardest in school as I enjoyed it and I never questioned its usefulness in the future. However, I struggled and questioned myself for a long time on what I wanted to pursue as a career. At that time, I could see myself doing lots of different things, but it was tough to pin a certain one down. It wasn't until I volunteered at a hospital that I found out I wanted to pursue a career in healthcare. Therefore, pairing my fun time volunteering and my enjoyment of science classes (particularly chemistry), I applied to university with the intention of going into medicine. I decided to pursue kinesiology as it was focused on the human body, and I attended UVic given its close proximity to home (within walking distance) and the circumstances of COVID-19. However, I did not enjoy my first year anatomy class at all, thus I needed to quickly reconsider what I wanted to do. Through my time shadowing (and eventually working) at a pharmacy and the fun time I had in organic chemistry where the professor explained to us different molecules and their medicinal uses, I decided to pursue pharmacy. I chose UBC over other schools such as UofA and UofT based off of the proximity to my home (Victoria), as well as the better weather and the pharmacists at work who recommended it as well. nan During my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, playing soccer and golf, watching the NFL (Baltimore Ravens) and NCAA football (Texas Longhorns), reading biographies on people and different companies, and playing video games (FIFA especially) nan I have an urban background he/him I would describe myself as someone who is industrious, hard-working, a good listener, patient, and a strong communicator.

I greatly enjoying being of service to others, and I think this is attributable to my Oma, who I grew up seeing help others all the time, even as she got older and weaker due to having a chronic disease. I also believe that I can fall victim to procrastination at times, and that I can have difficulty at times asking for help. However, I can truthfully say that I make an honest effort to improve each day. nan I would be able to help and support my mentee as I could share insight on certain transitions in life, as both of my older siblings left and moved out in quick succession, leaving me to navigate a position I had never been in before. I could provide insight on adapting to new social circumstances, as none of my friends from secondary school went to my specific university, thus I had to make new friends there, only to have to make a whole new set of friends and connections at UBC, as nobody from my program there applied to pharmacy.

I like the idea of working with doctors and nurses because we are all experts in our own fields when it comes to providing patient care. In Prince George, you might know that we have the Northern Medical Program, and the Occupational and Physiotherapy UBC Northern Cohorts. I am hopeful that we will get out Northern Pharmacy Cohort, and I would love to be an associate professor there.

UNBC was my first choice because that was home and I received a full ride scholarship for there. I chose a program that got me all/most of the pharmacy prerequisites and one that I can get a degree from if I did not get accepted right away or chose a different career path. UNBC entrance requirements did not require and AP or IB classes, so getting accepted was not a concern as long as I submitted all the necessary information on time.

I actually got married this past summer and one of the reasons why I chose pharmacy as a career is because I can still be a mom and support my family financially. We were economically/finanially challenged growing up and it was a struggle at times. Aside from the work-life balance that pharmacy offers, I also chose pharmacy because I am passionate about helping others but cannot handle the blood and guts like nurses and doctors (I have mad respect for them and all that they do). With the way that practice is changing, pharmacists are becoming more valued in the healthcare team and I love working collaboratively with other health care professionals to provide the best patient care possible to them.

1047634577,"I am studying anthropology (a social science) and I�m in my fourth year at UBC. Anthropology is just the study of why humans do the things they do. I went to UBC straight from high school. nan I�m not really sure what I want to do since a lot of what I�m interested in won�t make enough money to live well on but are important in society anyways. A lot of what interests me are in the social services such as working for a non�profit or charity, city planning, being a librarian or a teacher, working with communities in Chinatown etc. My dream careers are to be an author, to open up a bookstore/caf�, or something in the arts/fashion fields. Ever since I could read, I wanted to be a writer, but this wasn�t something my family/community could accept. I am Chinese with immigrant parents so the stereotype is to be a doctor, lawyer or engineer LOL and I absolutely did not want to do that. I thought I was bad at science and math and I really liked to read and write, so that kind of influenced what I wanted to study at university. Of course, I guess what I studied at university ended up influencing what I want to have a job in. Being Chinese Canadian and with immigrant parents, who were a bit stereotypical lol, I went into university straight from high school with no gap years and this was during the pandemic in 2020. I applied to two schools, all local since my parents wanted me to stay close, and I got into both. I chose UBC because, one I really liked the campus and it was higher in prestige, and two my parents probably wouldn�t have liked me going to SFU as much as UBC (and I honestly would�ve have felt the same too). I did switch majors. Originally, I wanted English, but my parents were not too happy about that. I also wanted First Nations and Indigenous studies, but my parents also thought that was too narrow. I did have a minor in Urban Studies but I dropped that to do my own research project in anthropology on outdoor sportswear and why Chinese people in Vancouver wear this type of style. I like anthropology because the readings are more specific and in depth about peoples� lives or situations. If I was better at doing my homework, I probably would have done something related to food or farming since I really enjoyed farming in my summers with an urban farming summer camp in the city. To this day, I think my parents still don�t know why I chose anthropology and what I�m going to do with this degree. A lot of my university journey was about balancing what my parents were worried about (job security, difficulty of program, its prestige etc) with what I wanted nan My main hobby is reading the internet. I�m on reddit a lot and my favourite places to browse are pop culture chat/faux moi, cooking/recipes/food, the ubc subreddit, starbucks, lushcosmetics, makeupaddiction/rehab and more. If I had the attention span to read, I�d do that, but I�m mostly scrolling through Instagram these days. I also like baking/cooking and I love watching food content on youtube. It�s a bit harder living alone to buy flour and other ingredients, so I don�t do it as much. I also love hiking when I can, which is never since I procrastinate and I don�t drive. I love the outdoors but didn�t have much opportunity to do much outdoors stuff. I also started embroidery but I�m sooooo bad at it right now. The main issue is time with school and life stuff like cooking, grocery shopping, laundry etc. takes up a lot of brain energy so I don�t often end up doing my hobbies. But yeah, those are my hobbies nan I have an urban background she/they, either or works as well as interchanged. A lot of how my personality works is from my culture, being Chinese Canadian. I had a lot of identity issues growing up since I didn�t really fit in with the stereotypes that a lot of my peers somehow ended up fitting in to. I�m shy and I don�t like talking to people, which made the transition to university and living alone very hard. I�m also not really close to my family, until much recently, since I had some struggles with mental health (anxiety and just a lot of sadness throughout my teens) that my parents didn�t really understand. My sister also did really well in school and continues to do well, while I can�t be bothered to even start my homework earlier now� Generally, if you don�t do well in school, talk back to your elders when they�re sexist, racist etc, have messy handwriting, don�t want to do the typical �Asian� activities, you�re viewed as a problem and/or just really weird. Obviously, not all Chinese Canadian people are like that, but this was (is?) something that I faced� And not fitting in, well, that�s a big thing for me now. I used to feel like I had to prove that I was Chinese to others, but now, I don�t. I also used to feel like I wasn�t enough unless I could get the academic scholarships or be top of my class. It sounds almost ridiculous as I still did really well in high school and uni, and a lot of people would love my grades lol. I�m also queer, which I think my parents don�t always understand or even want to accept. I didn�t find out about this aspect of my life until grade 9 when I joined the LGBTQ+ club lmao. Being queer helps me understand that I don�t often live/work/exist in binaries nor �boxes.� There�s a flexibility in life that I�ve come to find after realizing this aspect of me. I developed more confidence moving away and having to actually ask for help or interact with people helped with my social anxiety. nan Hmm� I think I�d be able to help with exploring identity, and finding ways to view oneself beyond school/grades/geographic location/situation etc as I�ve had to discover who I was beyond my academic performance. In addition, I did have to learn how to adult like doing laundry, grocery shopping, finding time for hobbies, going to the doctor etc. so I�d also be able to help with those topics. While I don�t have a disability, but I am a bit familiar with disability resources at universities as well as what support one can access for mental health. Also down to talk about just general mental health/parent/immigrant/being a POC/being Asian, Chinese experiences as well. I worked two holidays at Lush (the bathbomb store) and it was very very fun. I also volunteered at a thrift store, and at community centres for spring break programs. nan I'm a virgo if you're into horoscopes.

I initially thought I would enjoy doing research, so I worked in a lab for a year as my co-op placement and realized research is not my passion. I have been volunteering in a hospital for a long time and patient interaction has always been my favorite part, so I decided to work in healthcare and study pharmacy where I'd be able to interact with patients and help them achieve their health goals. I didn't get in to my first choice at UBC out of high school, so I decided to go to McMaster University where I studied general life sciences. I was very homesick and had some personal problems going on, so after first year I transferred back to UBC to study microbiology & immunology. I solely picked this program because of the prestige due to it being hard to get in, not because I was passionate about it. I was in this program for 2 years, then did one year of co-op at a biotech company because I wanted some research experience. I realized I don't enjoy research, so after I finished my co-op in 2023 I switched to the Doctor of Pharmacy program at UBC and I'm doing first year right now. nan I am an avid fan of nintendo games like Legend of Zelda and Animals crossing.

1047631584,"I attended the University of Victoria from 2018-2023 where I completed a Bachelor of Science in Biology. nan My dream job is to become a doctor. Surprisingly, this is something that my parents had always told me to do. While this initially started my down a scientific path in high school, there was a period of time where I was conflicted as to whether I was pursuing this career for myself or for my parents. However, once I started university and had the independence to pick which classes I wanted to take, I started to realize that this was something that I genuinely wanted to pursue. I had a couple of opportunities to get involved with research during my undergrad which I absolutely loved. I found a passion within medicine and research. I started to consider academia/research as a possible alternative career path, but I still felt as though something was missing. For me, being a doctor encompasses my passion for medicine and human physiology while also being able to interact and connect with individuals. While this is my primary goal, I am also keeping opportunities open to finding a career within research. However, if time, grades, and money did not matter, I could also see myself becoming an artist and selling handcrafted artifacts. I started university right after completing high school. I had applied to several universities across Canada, with my dream university being UBC. While I was fortunate enough to be accepted into all of the schools I applied to, I ended up going to my last choice, which was the University of Victoria. This is not because this school was 'bad' by any means. It was only my last choice because I was wanting to move out and experience living in a different city. The main reason why I ended up going to the University of Victoria ultimately boiled down to my parents. Growing up, my parents had always been quite strict and overbearing, and as a result, they wanted me to stay at home for university too. I was also fortunate enough to have them support me financially with university fees. As a result, I ended up staying at home for my post secondary education. Looking back at this now, I wouldn't have wanted it any other way! I started university wanting to do a degree in Biochemistry, but I quickly learned that chemistry was not for me. For a couple of semesters I switched to a Bio-Psyhology degree, as well as a biology degree with a minor in environmental sciencies. Eventually I ended up sticking with just biology. The reason for this is that I loved the flexibility this degree provided me with. I had several electives where I was able to pick and choose the courses that I was really passionate about. I thoroughly enjoyed my undergraduate degree. I believe that staying at home was ultimately the best decision for me, and I had an amazing five years at UVic! nan My hobbies include a little bit of everything! I love to do anything art related, whether it be painting, sketching, knitting, or stitching. I am currently learning how to crochet, and my next venture is to learn how to do pottery. I also love music. I am a self-taught guitar player, and I was also a huge band nerd in high-school (I played the flute). I love to listen to music in my free time as well! My favourite genres span from hip hop, indie/alternative, rock, folk - a little bit of everything. Living on the west coast of BC, I feel grateful to have so many beautiful places to explore. I love to do things like hiking, camping, and kayaking. My goal for the next couple of years is to learn how to skii. On a more day-to-day basis, my free time consists of going to the gym, and watching lots of Netflix! nan I have an urban background she/ her I love building connections with others and providing guidance and support in any way that I can. I strongly believe in creating welcoming and non-judgemental spaces for open and honest conversation. I come from a South Asian background, and I think I can relate closely with other second generation children whose parents immigrated to Canada. My upbringing was also fairly strict and controlled. Navigating this taught me many important lessons and also played an important role in shaping who I am today. nan My main goal as a mentor would be to offer support as my mentee enters this transitional period of their life regardless of whether this includes education or career related advice.

I currently volunteer with children with developmental disabilities, at the hospital with the older adult mental health unit, and at the Harm Reduction Center at the University of Victoria. nan I try my best to be as open and welcoming as I can!

1047630613,"I am a second year student majoring in Neuroscience at UBC Vancouver. Before this, I was at the University of Toronto St. George campus for a year and a half where I studied general life sciences. nan My dream is to be a general practitioner with a subspecialty in addiction medicine. Some other careers I am interested in is psychiatry or research on the brain and behaviour. Spending most of my time in Vancouver and recently in Toronto, I saw many people in the community struggle. This inspired me to pursue a career that could help the community, especially in terms of accessible health care. Also, I struggled with having migraines and anxiety, and going through these health problems pushed me towards a career where I could help others going through similar situations. The first post-secondary school I attended was the University of Toronto to study Life Sciences. I dreamt of living in the city of Toronto; I thought I would be a city girl, and enjoy my days with a lot of new friends and have the post-secondary life of my dreams. I also thought I could prove myself at UofT. UofT is known to be an acadmically rigorous school, and I wanted to show others I could make it. So, you could say that my first choice of going there was more driven by selfish ambition. However, the year I entered school was during the worst part of the pandemic- I remember my classes and labs being all being online. With no place to meet new people, I felt alone in a new city. It was a tough time emotionally, as during my first semester I had a fall out with my best friend. At the same time, my migraines became worse and I stayed in my room every day, growing more and more isolated. As most of my classes were online too, I decided to take a break from school. I knew that if I kept going, I would only feel worse and not perform as well as I wanted to. I took a semester off after my first, and came back home to Vancouver. It was one of the rock-bottom moments of my life; however, it was also the moment that changed me the most. I navigated how to deal with my migraines while working full time as a medical office assistant. I also applied to transfer to UBC. However, to my dismay, they did not accept me and I had to go back to Toronto. It was a scary move for me, because it was the place I was so hurt and sad in. Once I got there, I started noticing more things in the city- the homeless man that was always there on my walk to campus, or the homeless youth I saw in front of the mall. I realized so many people struggled in the communities I saw. I started to work very hard in school with a new passion, which was to help everyone receive the care they deserved. It was strange- as soon as I found the reason I was even in post-secondary, I started becoming actually interested in the courses I took. Chemistry, biology, and math... everything was just so intriguing. Though I still went through struggles, I pushed through them and applied a second time to transfer to UBC, where my family was and the program I wanted to be in was. Thankfully, after a long, hard year at UofT, I was finally accepted to study Neuroscience at UBC. Though I would never go through this experience again, I am so thankful I did because it helped me grow and learn so many valuable lessons including resilience, self-care, and patience. nan I like to play animal crossing, sketch, bead, and watch fashion/makeup/vlogs on YouTube. I also like walking my dogs, swimming, and occasionally reading.

I believe family medicine achieves these goals and help me become a well-rounded person who advocates for issues affecting the community I love.

1047628812,"I'm a second year computer science major at UBC! It's technically my third year here but I'm officially a second year because I changed my major from behavioural neuroscience!! I originally planned to be a doctor but changed my mind after taking a CS class and here I am :) nan I'm not 100% sure what career I'll end up in but it'll definitely involve some sort of programming. I really like the idea of combining computer science with healthcare/biotech :) There's a couple reasons I chose to pursue a career in CS, a big one is the flexibility. CS/coding overlaps with pretty much every other field in existence so if you're passionate about healthcare, business, finance, gaming, research - almost everyone needs software engineers (so you can pursue your dreams while also having a stable job and getting to do some pretty cool stuff)! Besides that, I've always been pretty logic-oriented and love solving complex problems (I even liked math in school!) and I really value the work-life balance that comes with tech positions. If time, money and grades didn't matter, I think I'd like to be a writer, but I'm also pretty happy to write on the side! I originally wanted to be a doctor so I started off majoring in neuroscience, but changed my mind after taking a Python coding class. Basically, while taking the midterm I realized for the first time that I was having fun while answering a question, which is when I knew it was time to switch! After doing more research I figured out that I could still help make a difference (I mean look at how AI is being used to diagnose diseases and power prosthetics - super cool!) while still getting to retain a healthy balance outside of school and avoid burning out like many medical students do. I was accepted into UBC with a full-ride so if you're interested in applying for scholarships I'd love to help with any applications! I chose UBC because of the neuroscience program (which I later switched out of) and also because it was significantly cheaper than leaving the province. If money was not a factor I'd love to have tried going to a school in America! nan One of my favourite things to do is watching and reviewing movies! My all time favourite is Jurassic Park because I grew up watching it all the time, but a more serious answer is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (I'm a huge Kaufman fan!) and basically any movie by David Lynch. When I have time I love to watch re-runs of older movies at my favourite local theatre - the Rio. If you're ever in Vancouver I'd definitely check it out!! I also like writing poetry and one of my fun facts is that I had a poem published when I was nine :D Other than that, I collect vinyls and have a bunch of originals from the 70/80s which I'm pretty proud of! I also used to play the harp but don't play often anymore because rentals are so pricey :( nan I have an urban background she/her I really value equal access to education because I'm the first in my family to get a degree!! This also made is pretty difficult to navigate university and there were many things I'd change if I could go back in time, but hopefully I can help prevent others from making the same mistakes! Another aspect of this is that I haven't had much financial help, which adds an additional layer of complication to the university experience. It can often feel pretty draining when you are dealing with rent money while trying to keep your grades up and boost your professional development, especially if you're surrounded by peers who don't have to worry about funding their educations nan I moved out when I was 17 because of a difficult family situation which meant I had to learn a lot of ""adult skills"" pretty early on. Because of this, I can help with things like renting for the first time, supplementing your income while in school, budgeting, understanding insurance, etc. I also having experience managing mental health issues and I'm always comfortable talking about heavier topics so don't hesitate to reach out if you need a friend :) Lastly, I work part-time as an instructor (my job is to develop and teach customized curriculum) so I would love to share my experiences with mentees interested in similar positions! nan I would love to be matched with someone pursuing post-secondary, specifically a student interested in the tech field.

1047628108,"I went to Kwantlen Polytechnic University and took Post-Baccalaureate Diploma for Operations and Supply Chain Management. I came from the Philippines, and before studying at KPU, I completed my post secondary education in chemical engineering. My brother graduated from the same program, I thought it was cool, so I decided to copy him. It was not as easy as I thought! But I like chemistry, and how things work, so the university life was manageable nan I was the fourth child in a brood of five. By the time I graduated from college, I unintentionally became the primary breadwinner for our family (because my three older brothers have families already). Even though I stopped for a year during college due to lack of money, I tried very hard to come back and graduate. And I did. So, when I try to think about a career that would enable me to earn lots of money, it was in vain. Because it is difficult to get a job you like as a fresh graduate, how much more if I try to get a high salary when I am just starting out. So, I just applied to every job I think I qualified; we use newspaper ads back then. That is where I found my first job as a buyer (I buy materials such as fabrics, hooks, etc. to make lingerie wear). That is how I came to work in the supply chain industry (how materials made are moved from factories to customers). I was not able to practice my chemical engineering background, but I was able to use the resilience and hard work (when I pushed myself to graduate from college) to perform my job well. I applied to a technical college of my choice (not my parents') and applied for the engineering program that I like. It was an expensive college, but I thought we are a middle-class family, and we can afford it. Only when I was already working when my father mentioned that he took loans every year to pay for my tuition fees. I mentioned I stopped midway college, around my 4th year in engineering. I was so sad, because I love studying. It was a dark time for me. Fortunately, my organization provided me a scholarship grant, twice, so I managed to complete my engineering program. nan I write postcards to my friends back home. I also watch food travel blogs in youtube with my family. I discovered camping recently and I'm thinking I want to do that more. I enjoy discovering hole-in-the-wall restaurants and my husband and I try a different place every month (the cheaper, the better). I use to travel before the pandemic, and I went solo backpacking once! It was an amazing experience. I also watch Korean dramas, or Thai, or Chinese, sometimes even Vietnamese. There's so many good series out there! I also love cooking/baking shows - we just finished watching ""Is it Cake?"" Season 2. I love reading books, but lately I haven't read any. I like fantasy, mystery/thriller, suspense and sci-fi novels. I started reading Nancy Drew books when I was in my sophomore year in high school. I also cook vegetarian and/or vegan 30-minute meals, because I love vegetables even as a kid. nan I have a rural background She, her, hers I believe I am an introvert, but when I started to lead a group of people at work, I need to be an extrovert sometimes. I am not close to my brothers and sister growing up, but when we all had our own families, we became closer. I rarely eat meat, because when I went vegan 2-3 years ago, I want to be healthy and take care of the environment at the same time. I truly believe that I can understand other people's shoes through the shows that I watch. I used to think that I was the 'bad sheep' of our family (because I have those episodes during college), but it turned out that I stayed with my parents, and now am giving back to them, because they raised me right and good. I truly believe I am a hardworker, but that did not happen without my support group of family and friends nan Personally, I do not like to be told what to do. I believe I have an independent mind, and I am capable of taking care of myself. But one thing I learned from my friends who had troubled childhood is that, when they realized their parents/family will not listen to what they have to say, I want to make sure that in my own family, and to my own friends, that I will listen. Whether it is active listening, or deeper listening, or just sitting quietly and hear them out, I will do that. Because most of the time, my friend or family member does not need my advice or my help or my suggestion, they just want someone to be there, and listen nan I came from a loving family and I had a normal and healthy childhood. But that does not mean that I am sheltered or naive, because my life experiences are not always good. But through believing in myself that anything is possible, and the belief that I have that by helping others, I help myself in achieving my purpose in life, I was able to push through any obstacle in my life. Help is always out there, and I don't usually ask for help growing up, but now, I ask. Because I cannot go through this life alone. I know that there are people who love me, and know that I am good, and that I am enough. nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047590948', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047586873', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047516306', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047582323', 0.97, 'mentor')]"
1047628107,"UBC (finished), UFV (2nd year) nan My background as an immigrant has significantly influenced my career aspirations, particularly my desire to become a doctor. Immigrating to a new country exposed me to challenges that have endowed me with a profound empathy for people who are vulnerable or navigating difficult circumstances. This experience ignited my passion for helping others, especially in their most trying moments. I consider healthcare to be more than just a profession; for me, it's a platform for making meaningful impacts on individual lives and entire communities. This is not only a reflection of my own experiences but also an aspiration to be the kind of support I would have valued during my own periods of vulnerability. I have started a second degree in nursing at the UFV.  nan I enjoy a wide range of activities, from team sports like basketball, rugby, and soccer, to video gaming and reading. I also have a keen interest in research and value my time spent in physical activities, whether it's at the gym or hiking outdoors. Additionally, I find relaxation and joy in spending time with my pet birds. These diverse hobbies not only enrich my life but also offer multiple touchpoints for connecting with mentees who have varied interests. nan I have an urban background He/Him While I may initially come across as shy, I have a strong ability to build meaningful interpersonal connections once I get to know someone. This characteristic has served me well in both my personal and professional life, enabling me to form lasting relationships based on trust and mutual understanding. My knack for establishing such connections defines a core part of who I am and plays a significant role in shaping my interactions and relationships with others. nan Beyond career and educational guidance, I aim to be a reliable support system for my mentees in various aspects of life. Whether they're navigating the transition from a rural to an urban setting, finding motivation, or mastering the art of ""adulting,"" I can offer practical insights based on my own experiences. If they encounter challenges, I want to be their go-to person for constructive advice and problem-solving. My strong ability to build interpersonal relationships means I can be a trustworthy confidant for them. From social skills and confidence-building to sharing tips on time management and self-care, my goal is to be a reliable resource they can turn to in times of need. nan In addition to my ability to provide practical guidance and emotional support, I believe my adaptability and broad range of interests make me a versatile mentor. Whether my mentee is passionate about sports, academic research, or personal growth, I can connect on multiple levels, providing a more enriching mentorship experience. Moreover, my strong interpersonal skills enable me to be not just a mentor but a reliable friend and confidant. I'm someone my mentee can always turn to, whether they're facing a challenging decision or simply in need of advice. nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047593961', 0.95, 'mentee'), ('1047549056', 0.95, 'mentee'), ('1047551740', 0.95, 'mentor'), ('1047627114', 0.95, 'mentor')]"

1047627115,"I am currently in my fourth year studying environment and sustainability and psychology. I was originally majoring in geography and minoring in social justice, though I changed my plans recently. nan I am currently trying to pursue a career related to mental health, such as counselling or providing mental health workshops. That being said, if I had no constraints, I would want to become a psychologist.I have always wanted to help others live their best lives. As a queer person, growing up with no role models was often challenging, and I would have benefitted from having someone support me and my mental health. As I grew older, I came to realize that I can use my experiences to help future queer youth.  My path to post-secondary began early. My brother moved away to attend school and I felt I needed to go to the same school as him so that we could be close again. He had chosen a very competitive school so I became immensely concerned about my grades and extra curriculars. At that time, and until I actually applied to university, I believed that my best fit would be law, particularly environmental law. My father encouraged my educational choices, and explained that I needed to study whatever I liked, as long as I was getting high enough grades to get into law school. For me, this resulted in not caring too much about my selection of undergraduate programs. After all, I believed the grades were all that mattered. As such, I applied to schools across the country, only in arts as I thought I would have higher success. After experiencing a lot of change in my family, I decided to move far away from home, regardless of the program that was offered. Now, I was no longer going to be with my brother and I was moving to a city I had never been to. Once I came to this conclusion, my current school became my first choice school. I entered in human geography. I chose this program with little thought as I did not believe that I had any interests. Unfortunately, this program did not suit me in the slightest. I took a few courses and found them to be boring and uninteresting. For a while, I believed that I was stuck in geography, which led to me taking Environment and Sustainability. I tried that for another year, I came to realize that that was not the degree for me either. I found it interesting, unlike human geography, but I did not envision any interesting careers related to the program. As such, I decided to take on another major - psychology. I chose this program as I discovered that there are many career opportunities in the field that do not require a PHD, meaning that it was feasible for me. nan I am the kind of person who loves trying everything out. Currently, my hobbies involve playing tennis and rock climbing as well as doing puzzles and crafts. If I am in need of a calming day, I like to spend my time reading outside in the sun. nan I have an urban background they/them I am very passionate about helping others. I have worked with my community for the past two years, though I am always looking for new opportunities to engage with my community. Further, I come from a family that virtually disintegrated as I was in high school. While I experienced ongoing trauma for a few years, I came to develop the greatest support and empathy for helping others. I believe that this impacted me and largely changed the person I was before. However, it drives me to seek out ways to improve the lives of others. Further, I have had to manage the realities of growing up queer. While I am fortunate in many ways, I had to overcome many barriers, including in health, in sports and in my family.  nan I have developed an excellent ability to navigate through many different resources available across British Columbia. For instance, I receive academic and workplace supports due to a disability. I am also well versed in academic struggles (from taking good notes to writing papers). I am also able to support those with family struggles as I have my fair share of them. Lastly, my disability limited my ability to participate in society in the ways I wanted to for about a year and I had to gain the motivation to return to performing the roles I missed dearly. In this sense, I am great for creating goals beyond academics and careers, such as goals for when you move out of your family home. nan I love interacting with different people. I believe that even if we differ, our connection can be greatly beneficial to me and the mentee. Further, I have lots of experience working directly with inviduals (from summer camps to babysitting), which has granted me with great interpersonal skills. nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047631584', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047588047', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047630613', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047584395', 0.97, 'mentor')]"
1047627114,"I am currently a second-degree student at UBC majoring in psychology. I previously attended the University of Alberta where I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Biology.  nan Medicine has always been a passion of mine since I was a child. To be a part of the process in helping people recover from illness is something that I find incredibly rewarding. A particular interest of mine is working in underserved immigrant communities. I was once an immigrant myself and I recognize the difficulties and barriers in accessing quality healthcare. I made it a mission that if I were to complete my medical degree that this would be an area of focus for the rest of my life.   My current journey in post-secondary education would not be considered conventional by any means. I realized upon finishing my first degree in Biology at the University of Alberta that my passion continued to be in medicine and in helping individuals. However due to poor academic performance as result of issues with self-esteem, self-concept, and the pressure I had put myself upon, this dream seemed distant. A gap year, where I worked in retail, followed by the COVID pandemic, made me realize that healthcare was still something I wanted to do, thus I decided to pursue a second degree at UBC, where not only have I been much more successful academically, but I realize the importance of taking care of my mental health and have developed strategies to better cope with dealing with work, research and school at the same time. nan I have a number of hobbies that I enjoy. I love music and making playlists for all types of  genre on Spotify. During the summers I love to hike and camp with my friends. Besides the outdoorsy stuff I also love a good night in, watching anime, and playing video games such as League of Legends, FIFA among others. Besides going to classes one of my favorite things to do on campus is to work out, at the university gym. Nothing beats a weightlifting session, after a stressful day! nan I have an urban background He/Him I would describe myself as incredibly hard working, someone who does not back down from challenges and adversity and is passionate about helping others. I am deeply loyal to my family and friends, because they have been my rock and support throughout my journey. I am extremely proud of how I have overcome obstacles that were dealt to me when I was a young adult. However, I know that this is only the beginning and that I can always do better and achieve even greater things.  nan As someone who has lived alone for most of my adult life, I would say I am definitely experienced in providing advice in navigating a new city, finding resources, and living independently. I can provide helpful advice in making sure one does not feel too lonely and maintain the connections to one's hometown and heritage. One of the ways that I do that personally is through cooking as nothing beats a dish that reminds you of your childhood and home. I can facilitate and provide strategies in time management, a skill that is not only important in education, but also in maintaining personal relationships especially when you have multiple commitments. Being an adult means, juggling finances, and I would be well qualified in providing useful anecdotes as well as my own personal budgeting excel program that I use to manage my own finances. Financial literacy is often a skill that is lacking in young adults, and introducing financial concepts such as budgeting, saving and responsible spending would be useful for my mentee. Another aspect is making decisions regarding healthy lifestyle choices. While I am certainly not a professional physical trainer, I can certainly help develop a basic regimen, that targets core muscles of the body. Exercise has been shown not only in improving physical health, but also mental health as well and was a key aspect in turning my life around.  nan I hope that the mentorship experience not only allows me to provide some guidance to you as a mentee but that I also learn a thing or two from you.  nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047567831', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047582592', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047567636', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047551740', 0.98, 'mentor')]"
1047627113,"I'm currently a student at Simon Fraser University, majoring in biomedical physiology. ???? I'm in my fourth year of study � it's been quite a journey!  My path to this point has had its share of twists. When I arrived in Canada at 17, alone and new to everything, I finished my last year of high school here. That led me to Langara College, where I started with general science. After a year and a half, I made the move to SFU and began my journey in the biomedical program.  Life often takes unexpected turns, and I'm navigating each one as I go. ?? I'm dedicated to learning and growing, and I'm excited about what lies ahead. nan I'm applying for med school next year, and it's all because of something close to my heart. When I was 7, my mom fought hard against an autoimmune disease. That's when I realized I want to make an impact through medicine.  But there's more to it. Medicine feels like a personal challenge � growing as a person while helping others. Life's shown me its tough sides � loss, depression � you name it. Every day I wake up, it's like a win against life's curveballs.  Imagine if I could go all out � diving into research and patient care. It's about making a difference, not just for others, but for life itself.  My background is like a compass for my med dreams. The battles I've seen, the losses I've felt � they've all shaped my drive to make things better. My career choice isn't just a job � it's about fully embracing life and making each moment count. ?? My path to post-secondary has been a bit unique, but it's led me to where I am now, which I'm pretty happy about.  Right after high school, I started working part-time to cover rent and school expenses. Instead of jumping straight into university, I chose Langara College. Why? Well, when I first moved to Canada, everything was new and overwhelming. I needed time to figure out my plans. Langara gave me that time to explore and get a solid education.  After about a year and a half, I made the move to SFU. It just felt like the right fit. Now, I'm studying what I love, and it's a great feeling. I've always kept up with part-time work while being in university � you know, that whole balancing act.  So, that's my journey � a bit of a twisty road, some decisions along the way, and here I am, happy and looking forward to what's next! nan Biking is a big one for me. A year after moving here, I got into it and even did some DoorDashing to make a little extra. ?????  Horseback riding is my way of finding clarity. It's like a peaceful escape that really makes me feel alive. ??  Nature is my happy place. Camping and hiking are my go-tos. During school breaks, you'll find me on farms, getting hands-on with nature. ???  Music is another passion. I can play the piano, and there was a time when I and my friends were out busking in Vancouver. I'm not just a pianist, I can belt out some tunes too. I've got videos to prove it, believe me! ????  So, that's me � biking, riding, farming, and making music. It's all about enjoying life to the fullest! ?? nan I have an urban background She/Her Alright, let's dig into what shapes me. ??  One of the most defining things about me is that I immigrated here when I was 17, alone, just before the whole COVID situation. It was a pretty intense time. Through all the challenges, I've learned something important � the power of not giving up. Even when things got tough, I kept going. It's like my motto became ""just one more day."" And guess what? All those ""one more days"" added up � it's been 4 years since I arrived.  The key thing I discovered? You don't have to tackle everything at once. It's about making it through one day, then the next, and the next. And slowly, you see progress.  Through all this, I've grown and created a life I'm proud of. I've surrounded myself with people who matter to me. It's like a reminder that perseverance pays off. ??  So, there you have it � my journey of moving here, facing challenges, and finding my way. It's all about taking small steps and never losing sight of the bigger picture. ??????? nan Absolutely, I've got your back when it comes to more than just career and education stuff. Here are some ways I can offer support:  Navigating Adulting: Transitioning to adult life and living on your own can be a big shift. I've been there � moving to an urban area from a different country altogether. I know the ropes, and I can share tips on budgeting, finding your way around, and getting settled.  Cultural Adjustment: Moving to a new country can be a rollercoaster of emotions. Adapting to a new culture and environment takes time, and I'm here to listen and help you navigate the ups and downs.  Motivation Boost: We all have those days when motivation seems to disappear. I've been there too. I can share strategies to help you find your drive and keep pushing forward, even when things feel tough.  Overcoming Challenges: Life throws curveballs � obstacles are a part of the journey. I've had my fair share, and I've learned a thing or two about resilience. If you're facing challenges, I'm here to lend an ear and offer some strategies for tackling them.  General Life Stuff: Sometimes, you just need someone to chat with about everyday things. Whether it's relationships, hobbies, or random questions, I'm here for that too.

I first wanted to be a doctor, and then a software engineer, and later I learned about the amazing combination of biotechnology in my major. My dream career would be somewhere in between, like a software developer for medical programs and research. In high school I really enjoyed my biology classes, I was especially fascinated with the labs as well. I also really liked my media studies classes but never had any prior experience with coding. My interest in biology made me interested more in the human biology and becoming a doctor, and my interests in media and video games made me interested in computer science. When I was in highschool I applied to many schools and different programs. I was accepted into several schools in different provinces and initially I really wanted to go to Queen�s university because of their advanced medical programs. After thinking about my goals and which programs offered me the most flexibility I chose UBC. UBC�s science program offered me flexibility because I did not have to pick my major right away. Instead, as a first year I could take a variety of science courses and learn about my interests and then pick which major I would specialize in. I wanted to try coding which I did for the first time in my first year in university and that gave me the idea to specialize in the combined major in computer science and microbiology. nan I love exploring nature and hiking.

1047627110,"The University of British Columbia, Kinesiology, first year.  nan In school, I have always had a passion for all things science-related, which led me to take a handful of science courses. However, it was not until I was diagnosed with scoliosis that gave me a real reason and fascination to continue this pursuit. My scoliosis had a major impact on my swimming, as well as many other parts of my life. It restricted my ability to swim or do many everyday tasks, but I eventually came to terms with it and learned how to work around it. And despite these challenges, it allowed me to learn more about my body and further my passion for the sciences for a new reason.  During high school, I challenged myself with multiple Advanced Placement (AP) courses, which transformed my mindset and study habits. Despite a challenging start in grade 8, I embraced a growth mindset and gradually improved by seeking help, refining my study techniques, and adopting a positive perspective on setbacks. As I progressed, I learned to efficiently manage my time, experiment with study methods, and ultimately excel in my courses. This journey not only improved my grades but also instilled in me the value of resilience and continuous self-improvement. nan I have always found myself drawn to anything computer-related, whether it be gaming, video editing, or watching youtube, these activities not only provide relaxation and entertainment but also allow me to express myself creatively and intellectually. Futhermore, when I was younger, I always wanted to be a youtuber and ended up spending a lot of my time editing videos, making thumbnails or even creating 3d art. Gaming is also something I enjoyed doing as an escape from everyday life, spending countless hours of my free time to improve my movements with a keyboard and mouse, and even making some money along the way. nan I have an urban background He/Him Fear shackled me during my childhood, as I was afraid to try new sports or play new instruments unless I was pushed by my parents. But surprisingly, I learned that overcoming the initial fear of an activity introduced me to a new world of opportunities. Ever since, my perspective has changed on what I originally viewed as intimidating. This allowed me to face my fears and tackle what I struggled with head-on. In competitive swimming, mindset is what makes or breaks a swimmer; not fearing failure or hard work is what has allowed me to reach where I am today. My mindset has also allowed me to persevere and set goals that many would deem to be too ambitious. Those who know me would describe me as hard-working and as someone who will stop at nothing once a goal has been set. Even though these goals appeared unreachable at times, not being afraid to fail and viewing pain as an indication of growth enabled me to exceed everyone's expectations. Through everything I learned, I was able to become the team captain of my swim team, which is something I am extremely proud of. It has helped me become a strong leader and role model for my teammates, and I hope to continue to challenge myself and also be an inspiration to those around me. nan I have been swimming competitvely since 2013. I quickly fell in love with the sport and, through my consistency over the years, was able to rise to the national level, as well as become the team captain. However, with practices every day before and after school, it did not leave much time for other activities. Nonetheless, I still managed to find time to excel in school and also find time for my own mental health. Through what I have learned in swimming, I would help my mentee build confidence, manage time effectively, and maintain physical and mental well-being. I'd also emphasize the values of teamwork, sportsmanship, and life skills. Furthermore, I work as a swim instructor and have also volunteered for organizations related to lifesaving and swim instruction. I have dealt with a variety of age groups, ranging from infants to adults.  nan I deeply value curiosity, self-improvement, and meaningful connections. The pursuit of knowledge and the desire to continuously learn and grow are at the core of who I am.

I love singing, dancing, instrument playing, composing, and everything musical. I enjoy performing on the stage, practising for a concert,  and participating in musical competitions. However, I had my ups and downs with my piano teachers. Too much emphasis on the piano and techniques,  but no space left for �playing� or having fun. If I had the opportunity, I would like to make a difference about that mindset and the curriculum design.  Dream jobs: Show hostess (when I was 4); A musician & a movie soundtrack maker (since 12 years old); A uni/college professor (at the age of 16). Well, I told everyone about this story. My original goal was to get into the piano performance program at the University of Melbourn in Australia. However, they didn't send out the offer until July when I thought I got disqualified and accepted UBC's offer in March.

1047590948,"University of Calgary, University of British Columbia (current year 3) nan Honestly, I am interested in attending law school because being a lawyer pays well. However, I also hope to be able to help others. I've been in some situations where I would have benefited from having a lawyer but instead lost thousands of dollars. I hope to someday be able to help someone in situations like mine, or at least provide advice so that kind of situation does not happen again. If money didn't matter, I would make art all the time. I love drawing and painting. Maybe I'd model too, I used to do it a little before, it was fun. My family is pretty well educated. My grandma has a Phd, my uncle is a doctor, my aunt did dna science stuff in school, my mom has four degrees and my dad has a degree in computer science. I think that university has always been part of the plan for me and a part of how I saw my future. I originally started university in open studies, I took law and society, sociology, french, chemistry, just a broad range of courses to see what I was interested in. That's what I would suggest everyone does their first year because you need a certain amount of credits to graduate anyways and not all of them will be for your major. Then I applied and got accepted to the faculty of science at the University of Calgary after my first year but also applied to the University of British Columbia. Arts was my first choice there, science was my second. I thought I would be able to choose which faculty I wanted later but apparently you can only have your second choice if you don't get into your first choice. So I started taking arts by accident, not really sure what I wanted to do. Then I started looking at what courses interested me. I was thinking about med school but there are some aspects of being a doctor I wasn't too keen on. So I decided law school was the path for me and after researching, I found that psychology interested me and would be useful in the future. I chose the University of Calgary originally because I had a high paying job in Calgary. Then I got laid off because of Covid and that's why I applied to transfer after my first year. I decided that the Calgary weather was not for me; it's too cold, also my best friend lives in Vancouver.

1047590921,"University of British Columbia, Neuroscience, 3rd year nan I am currently aiming to become a doctor (in particular a neurosurgeon), and I plan to take the MCAT either this summer or next. But I am not one hundred percent set on going to medical school. I am still open to pursuing other careers, which would involve going to grad school instead. My dad has bipolar disorder which led me to initially become interested in psychology, but at the same time I think that the way mental illness is currently being treated (mainly via medication) is less than ideal, which is what got me interested in neuroscience. Neuroscience combines biology, chemistry, and psychology, and looks at the biological basis of mental processes, the *why* instead of just treating symptoms. This got me interested in neuroscience research, but after working in a lab last summer, I am now leaning more toward neurosurgery, for many reasons. I applied to two universities and got into both, but it took me right up until the deadline to decide where I was going to go. I really liked the program at one school, but I liked the campus and city better where the other school was located. I went to university right after high school, but my experience wasn't typical because for the first time ever school was fully online, and this made it really difficult to meet people and make friends. Thus, when I finally got to be in-person I had an appreciation for the ability to socialize, and I really wanted to make an effort to meet new people and make the most of my experience. It taught me to appreciate the little things. nan In high school I used to be quite an avid artist, and I still have many of my paintings hanging in my apartment, but now that I have to spend so many hours in front of my computer, I like to use my free time to be active.

I still occasionally struggle with motivation but I have learned a lot about myself since then, and I am better able to find motivation now 3. overcoming financial hardship: my dad has been unable to work due to his disability for many years now, and thus my family was unable to fund my education. I spent many months applying for scholarships so I am able to advise on the application process 4. living on your own/�adulting�: I have been living on my own for 3 years now, and I cook most of my meals, manage my finances, keep my apartment tidy, buy my own groceries, etc. It may seem daunting at first to move out from home, but I promise you you're capable of it, and I am here to help get you ready for that 5. managing a disability: I have ADHD, so this makes it particularly difficult to stay on task and not get distracted.

From a young age I was interested in the environment and living things, and passionate about helping others succeed. In high school I really enjoyed my Biology and Chemistry classes and had the opportunity to attend a program where I spent a week in a research laboratory at UBC and it made me want to study science.

I couldn't play hockey and I couldn't go to school (because I didn't apply that year) and had nothing to do. Luckily, my friend helped me get a job at the Richmond Olympic Oval as a Sports Attendant. From there, I earned enough money to do a bit of travelling, where I felt like I was ready to go back to school. I decided to apply to UBC Vancouver and UBC Okanagan to pursue Kinesiology, following my passion for sport and exercise. I unfortunately did not get accepted to UBC Vancouver, but it was a blessing in disguise. UBCO matched my personality a lot better and I was able to become a lot closer with my classmates and professors thanks to the smaller size of the community. I am still really close with my professors, keeping in touch through email, and my best friends are people I have met from UBCO.  nan My current daily activities include going to the gym, then to school, then to work. My free time activities include playing and watching hockey, book club once a week with a group of friends I went to high school with over zoom. Monthly - weather dependent - I like to golf and snowboard with friends a family. nan I have an urban background, I have an urban background but have lived for 6+ months in a rural area He/Him No nan Based on my life experiences, I would be able to provide support and advice on how to make the transition from high school to college/university. In particular, I would be able to help individualize my support to my mentee by addressing any concerns and those that I feel I may not be knowledgeable, I would use my network and people around me to help answer any questions. I lived away from home from 16-21 years of age, living with and without roommates, which I may be able to help with any insights on living without your parents. I went through many academic struggles but found ways to improve grades and study habits each semester. I have shared these strategies with the first year students I teach and they have said that they are helpful.  I also think that if you're moving away for the first time it may be difficult to make friends, so tips like joining intramurals or school clubs help. In terms, of finding motivation I've worked as a personal trainer for a few years now, and one thing I've emphasized is that motivation may come once a week even once a month, but you can have discipline everyday and that goes for anything in life. Of course I don't have all the answers but I believe that I can offer support within my scope and hopefully make a difference in someones life.  nan I do not identify as an indigenous or a LGBTQ mentor. Growing up,  I was a visible minority in high school, hockey, and during my undergrad. My mom is Filipina and my dad is Chinese. My family comes from a lower Socio-economic status which made it difficult to put me in an expensive sport like hockey. Fortunately, we were able to get financial aid through a local sport program so I could get the opportunity to play the sport I love.  nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047514156', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047582721', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047583222', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047567532', 0.97, 'mentor')]"

1047588047,"SFU Bachelors of Arts, Psychology (Dropped out in the early 2010s), Douglas College Bachelors of Arts, Applied Psychology Honours, Counselling Concentration (currently 4th year, about to graduate in a semester) nan Currently, as I'm finishing my bachelors at Douglas, I am hoping to continue on to completing my Master of Arts degree in Counselling Psychology in Canada. From then on, it would possibly lead into a PhD in Counselling, but that's further down the road. The career I'm hoping to pursue is in the helping field, specifically with parents and children (or families in general terms).I am fortunate enough to be able to be in a situation where I am able to chase my dreams without worry of money or time. I've had many stumbles throughout my late teens/early twenties that have led me to want to be able to help children/teens in need. I know what it's like to be in a situation that's new and scary and not have anyone to rely on or lend a guiding hand. I personally believe that children/teen mental health is something that is underlooked, or inaccessible for a lot of the population, so I'd like to be the change I want to see in the field. After high school graduation, I had already planned to go to post-secondary because that was the plan for all my friends at the time. I got into every program I applied for, from here to the east coast. However, I decided to stay home and go to SFU, as it would be cheaper and I would be near my friends. I did not know what exactly I wanted out of my time at SFU, so I felt lost and unsure as I took classes.Even before high school ended, I was struggling with depression but no one in my immediate support system understood how to deal with that. This was exasperated by a falling out with my friend group, being unsure of why I was even at post-secondary, and the worry of my mom and brother of my condition. In my second year, I ended up withdrawing from school, as I could not even bring myself to get out of bed at that point. I spent a couple of years doing nothing, becoming an invalid (in society's eyes). However, I was lucky, my mother never gave up on me and always tried to reach out and help, even if she didn't understand what was going on. Eventually, I gathered enough strength to start my life again, however slowly. I took odd jobs here and there, ended up working at the bank for a while. This is where I learned that I loved talking to people one-on-one, and solving their issues together with them. The sales part of the job I abhorred but it gave me a sense of direction and purpose. At that point, I was determined (with a little push) to start school full-time again. I decided on a smaller college as it was cheaper and the classes were smaller (which I found to be very beneficial). So I quit my job, and I started at Douglas College right before the pandemic hit. Since then, I've been slowly chugging along, working my way to a normal degree. It was in the last leg of my third year that I realized that I aspired for more than a Bachelors as I wanted to become a counsellor. This led me to change the boundaries of my degree as I aimed for graduation in the honours program. I've been learning to work with faculty to create and implement my thesis research project in my fourth year and it's been very illuminating. nan I spend a lot of my time on the computer. A lot of my hobbies revolve around playing video games (I've played games since I was a young boy), watching tv shows, and movies, and listening to music. I love all different genres of music, whether it's old or new. My current flavour of the month artists are Smino, Dev Lemons, and Carly Rae Jepsen. However, my all-time favourites include Frank Ocean, the Weeknd, and Death Cab for Cutie. Besides that, I love films. Films got me through a very difficult time in my life. I love most genres of movies, but I have a special place in my heart for coming of age films as they were the ""in"" thing when I was going through a very tough time. Recent films that I really enjoyed are Vengeance, Everything, Everywhere all at Once, and Barbarian. My favourite film of all time, weirdly enough, is a 2010 coming of age romantic comedy called Beginners with Ewan McGregor and Melanie Laurent.Other than that, I love going to concerts and live music. Something about the atmosphere and vibe just hits differently at those venues. I used to play jazz (tenor saxophone) during high school, so I know how it is to be on stage and playing to a crowd of people. I hike during the summer with friends. I'm very lazy when it comes to exercise but I regularly go to the gym with another friend.Honestly, I'm quite open-minded when it comes to hobbies and interests. If it's something that someone is genuinely interested in, I will be there 100-percent of the way as well. nan I have an urban background He/They No nan I know what it's like to have a plethora of disabilities. Besides bouts of depression, I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis a couple of years ago, possibly due to the stress I felt during my time at the bank. So physically, I find myself weak at points (without any symptoms of sickness). This revelation has brought me thoughts of mindfulness of my body, management of daily stressors, and overall just taking better care of myself.Motivation is also something that's been heavily weighed upon in my life. Even when I was young, I've never been one with burning passions or interests. It took me 25 years of my life to finally land on what I want to be in life or how I want to continue living as I got older. I can be pointed out as an example of someone who may have ""meandered"" (in the eyes of society) but is still working on becoming who they want to be (however slow that may be). My personal creed is that as long as I'm moving forwards in life (from my point of view), that's good enough. The big secret people don't tell you is that most adults are just as lost and anxious about their futures, they just may not have the time to think about it.I know what it's like to feel as though there isn't someone there to keep you from failing at your first try (I grew up without a father) at things, I still get anxiety when I start something I'm new to. However, that doesn't stop me from giving an earnest effort at it, even if I stumble or fall.  nan I am bisexual, I am nonbinary (AMAB).

1047587534,"Rural Pre-Medicine Class of 2022, UBC Doctor of Pharmacy Class of 2026 nan I have always known that I wanted to pursue a career in the healthcare field. Even during high school, I knew that this was something that I wanted. I just wasn't entirely sure what I wanted until later on. Initially, I had my sights set on dentistry and considered other options as well. Realistically, I wasn't set on anything and I was keeping my options open. During my second year of post-secondary, I really started to think that pharmacy was something that really interested me so I started getting shadowing experience to see if I liked it. Ever since then, I have worked to get myself into that field and I am currently studying in my first year of the PharmD program at UBC! I am so lucky to have been admitted to my dream program of Pharmacy at UBC. When I first started my undergrad, I actually wasn't set on pursuing a career in pharmacy. Which I think is absolutely fine because not everyone is able to pick their future career at the age of 17/18. I started the Rural Pre-Medicine program fresh out of high school knowing that it would put me on track for a job in the healthcare field (and I could do it in my hometown, which was a bonus). This program was amazing because it provided me with all of the pre-requisites for any professional program (UBC med, pharmacy, dentistry), while also allowing us to hear from students and working professionals in those fields to allow us to form opinions on the various programs available to us after RPM. I firmly decided during my second year of the program that I wanted to pursue a career in pharmacy. I still decided to finish the three years of the RPM program and worked from then on to keep my grades up and apply to the PharmD program at UBC. nan I have been a figure skater for as long as I can remember and it has been the main sport in my life since I was 4 years old.

I have developed good time management skills, studying skills, transitioning from high school to post-secondary - and even transitioning from post-secondary to a professional program (this was a huge transition for me this year). Also, because I was born and raised rurally, I would be able to help them work through or talk about the culture shock of moving to a big city for school!! I also think that I would be good at being there for them emotionally because even though it feels like forever ago, it wasn't that long ago that I was in their position. nan Obviously, it would be great to be matched with someone that wants to pursue something similar to me because I feel that I could support them on that track, but I am open to being paired with anyone!  nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047567532', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047640464', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047582923', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047636818', 0.97, 'mentor')]"
1047587175,"nan Other I've always had an innate love for the universe and a captivating desire to discover and endlessly learn about its anomalies. Astrophysics became my initial interest, which branched out into cosmology. One of my favorite movies is interstellar, produced by christopher Nolan. If you aren't familiar with the plot, it goes along the lines of not too far in the future the earth is dying due to crop failure and poor air quality due to dust storms. A single father who was a pilot and ex engineer, ended up being selected to go on a mission to scope out habitable planets by travelling through a worm hole. Before this happens, his daughter tells him there's a ghost in her room that has been knocking over books, but he says its nothing. He leaves earth with a few other people on the mission. In the end, he ends up being lied too about the nature of the mission and leaves to try and get back to his daughter, Murph. He ends up falling into space into a 5th dimensional plane that was constructed as 3D so he could access it. It turns out that he was the ghost who communicated with Murph in the past, and through the plane he sends her the binary code to help the world. This is a very simplfied version of the movie, but needless to say, it shattered my mind. The depiction of the worm hole and the supermassive black hole had me enthralled to know more. The overall hook however was how the 5th dimension was portrayed, it left me so infused with wonder that a genuine spark was created in my heart. Ever since I was expected to think of a future career, my longing has always been science based. I have such a deep-rooted need to grasp all the information and curiosities in the world and beyond it. I think at this point overall, I want to be an astrophysicist. However, I considered becoming an astronaut as well, I would do anything to actually be up there, studying my passions up close. However, I don't have 20/20 vision and my lungs arent up to par. I actually been very conflicted about whether it's too far of a stretch to shoot for being an astronaut for those reasons. I am also artistically inclined; however, I haven't really considered going to school for it because I don't want it to lose its meaning. I need art as an emotional release, not a stress factor. But through that I found that maybe I could pursue aerospace engineering. I could combine my love for design with my love for physics. and math. I am still figuring out the exact coordinates of my destination, but you can never have that planned for 100% accuracy. I am confident that I'm going in the right direction at the very least, and that I will end up where I am meant to be. nan I have plans to go straight to post-secondary school in the Vancouver area once I graduate. I want to study astrophysics through a Bachelor of Science at either UBC or SFU. I would do anything to travel Europe before I go but it doesn't look like that's in the cards for me right now, considering tuition fees. My favourite subject in school is probably either English or Physics. English has always been important to me, because like I mentioned earlier, I have a love for art, all forms of it. Along with painting and drawing I am also partial to writing stories and poetry. Poetry is especially important to me. It goes hand in hand with my need to have emotional release through artistic expression. My go to presents for friends and family are either paintings or poems, and if you receive a birthday card from me, it is more likely than not to resemble an essay. Branching out to more classes of the arts, I am a theatre kid. It isn't my favourite class I would say, because I face a bit of a struggle against anxiety, but the musicals are definitely something I enjoyed more than the class itself. It is so endearing to be in a group of people, all working together to reach a common goal, and through that process you become like family. The difference in atmosphere for me between the class and production is that people who are in the musical actually want to be. many people in drama class take it because they don't want to take anything more difficult. Thats why, in said environment where everyone is friendly and positive, I feel safer and more relaxed.   My main hobby is by far any form of art. My number one however, is music. I am in a band called ring system, and I've been in it since about grade seven. It's not your typical band, its actually more of a community thing. It's a band that surrounds the kids who take music lessons with our instructor Ian. Starting in early middle school, late elementary, kids are allowed to join until they graduate, which is the point where the lessons end. There are about 30-40 of us in total, and every year we put on two concerts called rock stock in May, and jingle bell rock in December. Music is hard competitor to space when it comes to what I love most. I need it to sleep, study, focus, eat and breathe. I can't explain in proper words how intensely it courses through my veins. I remember my first time on stage, I was on the verge of throwing up from nerves, but the moment and started feeling the music and opened my mouth to sing, I was instantly calmed. It still to this day stumps people when they ask me how I'm sacred to cross the street sometimes but not to get up and perform in front of hundreds of people. The answer is simply just music itself. My very first song was wanted dead or alive by bon Jovi, I was his biggest fan in middle school. Looking back on it now, I completely butchered it but, in the moment, I was happy. My most recent songs were hysteria by muse and Rhiannon by Fleetwood mac. I do have my own band in the works with a few of my friends from ring system who are my age. They also have plans to go to Vancouver for school and I'm hoping that after graduation, the music scene isn't over for me. I am also very into sports and keeping athletic in my spare time. My main two sports are hockey and soccer, but I do also enjoy long distance running. Unfortunately having asthma screwed that over for me but I am constantly training myself by running as often as I can, so that maybe eventually I can overcome it. I'm not a big party person, nor do I really have many good friends that I can go out with often, so my idea of fun is spending as much quality time with the ones that I do have, being my best friend who lives next door. It's not that I don't like people, I've just always gotten along with individuals who are older, and they always end up going away to live their life, and when I do get close with people my age, they become caught up in things that don't really serve me and how I want to live my life. I try my hardest to remain mindful of the things and people around me, taking in the world as it is, good and bad, that's why I often don't feel like I fit with most people, at least not for very long. It's for this very reason that my one of favourite hobbies is being outside in nature, with my dogs.  No preference nan she/her nan nan nan I would greatly appreciate help with adulting, especially in the big city. I live on an island up north with a population of around 13,000 people. I'm often in Vancouver with my mom, or to visit my father so it's not that I'm not used to it, but I usually have help, which is the big thing. I am currently visiting the city and I have taken transit by myself twice so far; I messed up terribly the second time and almost cried about it. I am just an anxious unorganized mess it would be awesome to have someone to help me out a little bit with getting more knowledge on these things.  It would be nice to have someone who is down to earth and understanding, but I am grateful for absolutely anyone, I just want to take the next step towards chasing my career. Growing up I was bullied quite often for being sensitive, not only by my peers but by adults as well. It was pretty disheartening to be told that no one would ever like me because of the way I was. I am still that way however, so they didn't do a very good job. I've come to terms with being in tune with my emotions, even if it's a little too much sometimes. This is why I mentioned emotional release through activities, I find that instead of crying, I can run or paint or sing. Crying is my issue, it just comes out with minimal control, and I always feel bad about doing it, so I get even more upset with myself. It becomes an endless cycle of self-deprecation, and it is so exhausting. Being so outcast because of it shaped me in a poor way at first. I didn't really have anyone telling me that it was okay, that was until I went to a summer camp last year that absolutely changed my life. The camp is called the YES camp, standing for youth excellence society. No title could ever amount to how beautiful the experience there truly is. I won a scholarship to it through the credit union, and when I made my way there, I almost opted out because I thought it was going to so much different than what it was. I don't think I've ever been happier than how I was there. It is pure heaven on earth, endless love and support from every single person there. You make a true family there every single time. I remember opening up to them about my emotional problems in one of our reflections at the end of the day, and they told me that it was a gift. They told me that I had empathy and that there wasn't anything wrong with me. You can't imagine the weight lifted off my heart when I found that people will accept and love me for the way I am. I obviously went back the next year, which is this year. I made even deeper connections this year than I did last year, two of which I am currently visiting right now. Camp made me want to be more mindful, more communicative, more immersed in my surroundings and more grounded. It didn't make me want to run away from myself anymore and it infinitely shaped me into a better person. My favourite activity was probably rhythms. Rhythms is where a playlist of all different types of music is played, and you all gather in the main hall and dance. You're not allowed to talk, just speak with your eyes and your body. It was the biggest release I have ever felt in my life. I didn't even like dancing until I did it. Love and mindfulness are extremely important to me and that is what I found there, without bounds.  nan nan nan",mentee,"[('1047581720', 0.95, 'mentor'), ('1047583027', 0.94, 'mentor'), ('1047590921', 0.94, 'mentor'), ('1047582717', 0.94, 'mentor')]"

I have taken this passion for biology and brought it into my post-secondary schooling, and in the future I hope to pursue a career in biology or in medicine. Specifically, I am interested in pursuing a PhD in biology, going to medical school, or pursuing another career in health care. Additionally, there are so many other careers in biology I would be interested in, such working as a conservation biologist, working as a scientists/researcher, and so many more! To get into post-secondary schooling, I applied to a handful of schools across Canada and eventually chose Queen's because it was a good school and I felt comfortable moving all the way to Ontario because I had friends moving there as well. I had a rough start in my first year of undergrad where I had a very difficult transition to the workload that is required for university classes. I struggled with my mental health in first year as well, but I slowly started to find my footing when I gained access to people who were able to guide me in life, and to mentors that led me in the right direction! I started getting involved in volunteer opportunities, working in labs, and working for organizations, and by the time I graduated I was able to apply to grad school and get accepted. I chose to come to SFU because it was a smaller school, and I really liked the professors that I interviewed with, so I felt like this would be a good choice.  nan I love to bake, and I have a whole instagram dedicated to the cakes, bread, and other creations that I bake!I am very passionate about biking, and I race on a road cycling team here in Vancouver.

During my 1st year I was in the Bachelor of Business Administration program. nan My career goals have changed several times throughout the years, but my interest in becoming a dermatologist has grown stronger and stronger, which led me to change programs from business to science. I have had skin issues for as long as I can remember, so I think it would be personally rewarding to help people with their skin. If I don't get accepted into medical school my first try, I might do a masters or work as a cosmetic chemist as I think it would be cool to formulate makeup and skin care. I didn't know what I wanted to study after high school and I was the only one out of my friends to not go to university right away. I didn't know if university was even right for me. I originally thought I would take one gap year, but one year turned into five. I moved to Melbourne, Australia to work as an au pair (live-in nanny) and I ended up loving it there and extended my visa. After my visa expired, I moved to Auckland, New Zealand to work as an au pair again. During my time there, I ended up getting an opportunity to work as a dental assistant even though I had no formal training. After about a year and a half of working as a dental assistant I didn't like my job anymore and this led me to move back home to give university a try. I was extremely nervous since I'd been out of school for five years and questioned if I was choosing the right program. I'm also the first one in my family to go to university, so I didn't have anyone to look up to and ask questions. I enrolled in the Bachelor of Business Administration program thinking I might major in marketing or finance. After one year I realized that the program wasn't for me and the jobs weren't going to align with what I wanted out of a career.

1047586133,"Capilano University, faculty of Arts with a major in Psychology nan As I near the end of my post-secondary education, I'm considering a career either as a Clinical Psychologist or a Lawyer. Currently, I'm favouring the prospect of working in law to build a more ethical and equitable society, but I don't feel that I can definitely state which career path I'll pursue quite yet. Law interests me because our laws are human constructs, decided on the data, history, and a common goal; and given that laws are constructs, they can be changed, erased, or enforced to better reach the goals of a community. Law provides the opportunity to aid those who don't possess the means to aid themselves. On the other hand, clinical psychology interests me, because it focuses on societal issues from the perspective of the individual, rather than the collective. Being the child of a father who was an Iranian war veteran and refugee, and a mother who never had the opportunity to pursue education due to her family's poverty, I witnessed my parents' lost dreams and past opportunities. I decided at a young age that I wanted to help make the opportunities of the upper-middle class more accessible for people born without the privileges that went in hand with being born into wealth or an affluent family. During my final years of high school, I chose to pursue higher education and wandered into the social sciences, which is where I was guided toward career opportunities that would give me the ability to help my society. The first year of my experience in post-secondary education was an unconventional and rather bumpy one. Coming from a family of odd-job workers, I had no financial security for the pursuit of an education that I would have to pay for. So, whether or not I was able to continue my educational pursuits was at the mercy of scholarships and my own ability to work. I was offered a few scholarships upon graduating high school, but since they would only cover my first year I decided to take a gap year to work full-time in retail and as a barista. During this year I saved as much money as I could, and began my education in January 2021. Initially, I had been accepted into my choice university in the engineering program, but I was dissatisfied with how impersonal the STEM field was: my free time was consumed with volunteering for human rights organizations, and with the economic collapse caused by the Covid 19 pandemic, the problems of the world were showcased for everyone to see. I remembered that my goal in high school had been to make a better community-- a better country-- and to help solve humanitarian problems. STEM did not give me the ability to reach these goals. So I decided to begin studying psychology, with the plan of either going to Law School or graduate school after completing my BA. nan I may have grown up in the city, but my parents' backgrounds ensured that I spent more of my free time in the forest than in the city. To this day, I spend most of my free time in nature hiking, backcountry trekking, foraging (especially for mushrooms), rock climbing, and kayaking. I am also an avid reader and writer: growing up books have always acted as teachers to me, and I continue to enjoy reading fiction as well as writing it. I also love baking (but not really cooking), weightlifting, and animals. nan I have an urban background she/her not particularly  nan I feel that, given my experiences, as well as those of my friends and family, I've managed to figure out many strategies that can benefit mentees in overcoming financial hardship, finding motivation, managing their time (especially making time for hobbies, socializing, and personal passions), and overcoming academic struggles. 1) Overcoming financial hardship: it would naive for me to suggest that even the most motivated and tough people don't find financial hardships to be the most difficult challenge that they face-- especially in a place as expensive as B.C. However, growing up below the poverty line has forced me to gain skills that allow me to save and invest money for the future. Without resourcefulness, I don't feel that I would currently be where I am today. To anyone who grew up with a similar background to my own, many of the ways that I've managed to overcome financial struggles may seem like common sense, or simply just be second nature by now. However, I am open to listening to any struggles that mentees might be having, and researching ways that can lift financial burdens.2) Finding motivation: school and life both have the power to make us lose our motivation as our workloads increase. It's completely normal and everyone experiences it at some point. There have been a few instances in my life where I've lacked the motivation to continue school, but I chose to keep pushing myself because the reward awaiting me was greater than the hardship I was facing. I believe that it's healthy to go through periods of lethargy, but motivation means eventually pushing yourself to move on and overcome your barriers. Strategies like maintaining a healthy social life, setting time aside for exercise, nutrition, and hobbies, managing studying hours, and more are all components in life that helped me stay motivated and succeed in life. Although at first glance the things we must do to remain motivated seem simple, finding the discipline to stay on track is the challenge that most of us have to rustle with. I believe that this is an area where can provide support, counsel, and planning to help mentees remain motivated and overcome internal barriers.3) Time management: one of the most vital components of an exciting adult life is time management. It can sound counter-intuitive because excitement is typically associated with spontaneity, but in reality, we only have time for spontaneity after all of the tasks of adulthood are out of the way. During my first year in college, I struggled quite a bit with managing work and school, and so did pretty much every other student I knew. After a long day of lectures, and then evening shifts at work, it seemed impossible to force myself to study for 4-7 hours and still maintain any sort of social life with my friends and family-- let alone time for hobbies. However, through discipline and research in learning theories, I learned strategies to make time for everything I wanted to do. From what I've observed, time management is THE biggest challenge that young adults struggle with after graduating from high school, and without guidance, it often seems like an unsolvable problem. I feel that by the second year of post-secondary school, most students have figured out the art of time management. I'd like to share the strategies I've accumulated with anybody whose interested because it's better to get a leg-up now than be overwhelmed in the future.4) Overcoming academic struggles: whether you're highly successful in the majority of your classes or are currently struggling to pass some, all students have the ability to thrive academically when they learn how to harness their intelligence. Academic struggles can often feel like they're our fault, but in reality, they can be the outcome of poor teaching, poor time management, circumstances outside of our control like mental health issues, or a plethora of other factors. Although everyone has a different background and is facing different challenges in life, the majority of academic struggles are easily solved. The reality is that a lot of people have a hard time studying because nobody has taken the time to teach them effective studying strategies, or shown them how to manage their time efficiently. In high school, we're often told to ""read the textbook,"" ""do practice questions,"" ""show up to class,"" and so on. But the reality is that there is no one-size-fits-all to learning. As a student studying psychology, I study the human mind full-time, and I have used the information that I've acquired about learning theory and cognition to create study methods that help me thrive. Many high school students never get the opportunity to realize how smart they really are, because nobody has taken the time to teach them how to actually learn. I feel that I can really help students find their personal learning style, and find enjoyable ways to stay engaged with their course material without becoming overwhelmed. nan A little about me: Throughout my high school years, I was involved in an assortment of clubs and extracurricular activities, so if any potential mentees are interested in learning how to manage these into their schedule, or use club directors as future references, this is definitely something I can provide insight to. I was never a student-athlete in my school, but I was a gymnast up until 10th grade. As previously mentioned in this application, my family background was below the poverty line, so in order to engage in sports like gymnastics I was responsible for getting funding myself through programs like JumpStart.  nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047516499', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047588047', 0.96, 'mentor'), ('1047582077', 0.96, 'mentor'), ('1047627115', 0.96, 'mentor')]"

In doing so, I made my major half biology and half chemistry. After taking the MCAT and applying to med school, I can say I am glad I majored in both subjects.  nan I enjoy playing video games.

I would love to work as an international consultant in Canada and continue researching and contributing to science and mining. I already have experience working in Chile (in two mines and two consultancies). Therefore, the next step in my career is expanding my vision to other mining operations around the world. I would love to teach rock mechanics in the future; so, I would like to get a PHD in rock mechanics. Finally, I would like to be a role model for future generations, especially women because female participation in BC�s mining industry is estimated to be approximately 14% (Statistics Canada, 2016 Census of Population). When I finished the high-school I wanted to study mining engineering because I was good in maths and science, so I decided to pursue an engineering program. In addition, mining is very popular in my country (Chile), so you can work in many areas, and I liked the idea. My first year in the university was really hard, but the next years were pretty nice. nan I love outdoor sports (hiking, trekking, biking...) - I love yoga, it makes me feel so good - I am very good at painting, I like to paint with watercolours - I like to read, I always have a book in my backpack - I love to travel with all my heart, it is the best experience for me. nan I have an urban background she/her no nan I have travelled a lot, so I would like to tell my mentee that the world is very big and that there are many opportunities out there to motivate him to open his mind.

1047584898,"I recently graduated with my Master of Science in Neuroscience from the University of British Columbia (November 2023). My research focused on the effects of pain and sugar on the hippocampus in premature babies using a mouse model. nan I am interested in careers in health and research, hence why I pursued a master's degree in neuroscience. In the future, I am planning to apply to medical school to become a physician. For me, a physician provides a balance of patient interaction, research, problem solving, and critical thinking that I strive for in a career. In high school, a majority of my courses were science-based as I knew I wanted my career to be in the healthcare field. For my undergraduate degree, I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Biology at UBC. In my last two years of my undergraduate degree, my interests focused mainly on neural systems and the brain, which led me to pursue my masters in neuroscience at UBC. I also volunteered in laboratories and participated in volunteering with Let's Talk Science, a program that provides basic science education to elementary school students in low-income communities. In another lifetime, my dream career would be a baker or cake decorator, as silly as it may sound. I love to bake and do food-based art, so if I could make these hobbies into a career, I would absolutely do it at a different stage of my life! At the moment, I am working as a clinical research coordinator at BC Cancer Agency and I really love that my job is a combination of healthcare, education, research, communication with physicians, radiation therapists, nurses, and patients all in one! I also get to do some cancer tissue processing, which provides more depth to the role.  When I began my undergraduate degree at UBC, I started my Bachelor of Science (BSc) program immediately after high school. Second year of my BSc was when students decided their majors; we ranked our top 3 choices, to which I chose: 1) Integrated Science, 2) Biology, and 3) Microbiology & Immunology. Integrated science was my first choice because the program was a lot more flexible in terms of courses you could choose compared to Biology and allowed students to more narrowly pursue their science-based interests. Unfortunately, I did not achieve my top choice in major. Instead, I got accepted into Biology, my second choice. Although the outcome was initially a blow to my confidence, I continued to pursue Biology courses and in years 3 and 4, I really loved my major and was able to take a lot of lab-based experience I gained from my undergraduate degree into my masters program. I graduated with my Bachelor of Science with a major in Biology in 2020, then immediately began my Masters of Science in Neuroscience program in 2020, which I completed in 2023.  nan My hobbies include baking, watching TikToks, and learning about space and the universe. Baking has been an activity I've enjoyed doing for years. One of my favourite recipes to make is a chocolate lava cake, which requires only a handful of ingredients and is very quick to complete. I can even share the recipe if you're interested! I'm currently planning to learn how to make coffee cake with an espresso buttercream frosting. My sister is also passionate about baking and makes the most amazing coffee cake, so I am trying to perfect her recipe for myself. Spending long periods of time on TikTok is also something I enjoy. I love being able to lay in bed and scroll through videos for hours - it�s my definition of relaxation haha. Recently, I've become very interested in astronomy, galaxies, and various planets across the universe. I've recently learned a bit about nebulae and rogue planets, and I'm trying to learn more about the physics of black holes. If you have any space knowledge you'd like to share or resources that could teach me more, I'd love to hear it! nan I have an urban background She/her. I am creative, ambitious, disciplined, and detail-oriented. I am also friendly, approachable, and compassionate. nan My main goal is to help students with their transition into post-secondary, specifically with work-life balance, working while in school, time-management and prioritization, and good habits to form before and during post-secondary. Furthermore, I want to help students who may struggle academically, especially as the workload in university is very different to the workload in highschool, and how to overcome those challenges. Being South Asian with a tight-knit family, I can also help with how to maintain boundaries with family members and seeking independence and autonomy while in post-secondary. nan I am a South Asian (Bangaldeshi) woman born and raised in Burnaby, British Columbia. Family ties are a major component of our culture and it is expected that we follow all guidance and advice from our parents in every aspect of our future, regardless of whether their advice aligns with our goals. Being part of a collectivist community such as Bangladesh has presented significant challenges in gaining individuality and autonomy over the choices in my life, relationships, and career goals, and it took a lot of trial and error to become my true, authentic, and autonomous self in the face of my parents' wishes. Although my family provides strong support and love for me, being able to dismember myself from their expectations of my future and holding my ground on my dreams and future path has been challenging, but extremely rewarding. For youth who are stuck in the crosshairs of appeasing their family's wishes but wanting to pursue their own goals, it's an experience I have plenty of stories on, and I am proud to stay that over the years, I've gained true autonomy of my life, relationships, and future while maintaining strong familial and community ties.  nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047567941', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047582077', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047637199', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047581892', 0.97, 'mentor')]"

As I gradually get promoted on my career path, I feel a need to further sharpen my marketing skills, hence I came to Vancouver to do a diploma in marketing.  I was a science student and at my secondary school, I was particularly interested in doing experiments in the laboraties, such as dissection of animals, DNA analyses and field study as well. So I got admitted to biology as my major in university. However, the 3 years there made me get clear of what I wanted.

1047584395,"Kwantlen Polytechnic University, Bachelor of Arts, English Major, 4th year nan My dream job is to be a high school English teacher. I always wanted to be a teacher when I was in elementary school because I have neat printing, I was a good student, and I liked to play school at home. As I approached high school, I developed a lot of anxiety around adult life and careers, and decided not to pursue teaching in an effort to escape the classroom setting for good. My poor high school experiences involved teachers that told the class not to strive for an 'A' grade, as they ""rarely awarded them,"" and others that insulted students and openly admitted that they dislike their job. This really broke the confidence of myself and many of my peers. Not to mention our effort in the class. However, in my final year of high school, I had an English teacher who changed my perspective. She was the most empathetic, caring, kind, understanding and encouraging teacher I had ever had. She shared details of the difficulties in her own life and taught us in a variety of ways in order to cater to each student's different needs. I finally decided that I would become an English teacher as wonderful as her. One that students will remember, and one that truly cares. The instruction aspect of teaching is important, but the mindfulness and connection aspect is arguably just as important. Believe it or not, I initially applied to UFV for the Graphic and Digital Design Diploma. I absolutely love art in all of its forms and really wanted to do something in which it was involved. The program is extremely competitive, though, and I had some serious self-doubt. I spent a whole year on my application portfolio. In waiting for my application status, I decided that a plan B was necessary. I considered my options, and this was when I decided that teaching was my second option. As weeks passed I became more invested in and excited about a teaching career. I was shocked to find out that I was accepted into the limited entry UFV GDD program. I was so confused, and decided to decline the offer and instead apply to KPU for a Bachelor or Arts in English. I was so nervous to tell my parents but they were very supportive of my decision. nan My hobbies include: reading, watching tv/movies, painting, making friendship bracelets, making things out of clay, hiking, cooking (trying new recipes!), playing piano, listening to music, knitting, crochet. nan I have an urban background She/Her nan nan In addition to academic, career, and general ""adulting"" life advice, I can help with extra curricular stresses, family life, financial difficulty, friendship advice, and team sport experiences.

1047584341,"University of British Columbia, Physics, 3rd year nan Ever since I was a child, my dream has been to become a physician. Medicine is a field I believe is integral to our lives and benefits everyone. This might sound conflicting with my current major, but there is so much physics involved in medicine such as medical physics and radiation biophysics. Becoming a doctor is a goal I am currently pursuing only on the basis that I want to help people and be someone people can look up to as a role model. I want to be a symbol of hard work and determination, of someone who has earned everything in their life. Specifically, I want to specialize in psychiatry. In addition, I also want to pursue business on the side and get into politics as well. As a physicist, I want to establish a business is the aerospace and defence industry. I want to balance the inequalities in our nations and directly address problems politically as well. Veterans of armed conflict are my particular focus as they are such an ignored aspect of our society. A number of veterans end up with mental illness, trauma, and addiction which is heartbreaking because they gave up their time, families, and health to keep up safe and are now discarded. I someday want to work to improve their economic and financial health by going into politics and the defence industry. I want to build devices that reduce injuries during combat and set up programs that help veterans transition back to society.I believe my goals are very intertwined because going for a career in medicine will give me a better understanding of the problems afflicting veterans and allow me to help them better. Currently, I am a third year Physics major at UBC Vancouver ho has written his MCAT and is currently volunteering at the UBC Hospital in both the emergency room and at infodesk way finding. A lot of people believe that to become a doctor who need to be a biology, biochemistry, or any major that deals with living organisms and the human body, but that is completely false, do what you love. All majors are accepted at all medical schools. You can be an english major, a psychology major or even a physics major like me and medical schools will look no different at any of you. Do what you enjoy is the advice I took and i am currently in a program which I am fascinated by. I went to university straight out of high school and was accepted into my first choice: Physics. I have always been interested in how our world works and after taking Physics 12 with an amazing high school teacher and former mechanical engineer I knew I just had t unlock the world's secrets. This led to me becoming a physics major. Now, after taking the MCAT, I have a clear view of what I am doing. My degree will be over soon (1.5 years) and I will apply to all the medical schools in Canada to pursue my goal of becoming a doctor. nan I am a big video gamer. I have been gaming since I was six and it's been an integral part of who I am. The stories, the memories and the bonds i have made with friends are invaluable. Working out is also another hobby of mine when I have time. My dad lifted weights when he was my age and he taught me everything I know about weightlifting. Furthermore, one of my favourite hobbies is creative writing. I have a vivid imagination and I am currently working on my first novel. Being a writer, reading is also a hobby of mine. When I am not reading textbook, you'll find me reading ""The Great Gatsby"" or some other books which are my favourite. Naturally, this has led to me being a big moviegoer. I don't watch a lot of TV, but I enjoy movies a lot, especially if they have a deep plot attached to them which I enjoy discusses about afterward with friends. nan I have an urban background He/Him nan nan I have a lot of experience working with students and I also have experience in course redesign. I work as a private tutor in Physics and Math and this has given me a lot of insight into the way other people think and their learning process. I love to tutor courses I struggled in, but perfected because it allows me to pass on strategies and techniques I used to succeed. Furthermore, I am a member of the Students as Partners project under Professor Allison Man as an undergraduate academic assistant. My job is to help redesign Astrophysics 200 which has greatly improved my skills as a tutor and has given me experience to the thinking behind generating academic content such as assignments, worksheets, exams, and creating a better learning space for students. I believe my experience in understanding the student mindset is an asset in helping my mentee unlock their true potential. transitioning from high school to university is a big step academically. There is a big emphasis on self-motivation and the controls are put in your hands which I believe require guidance. Furthermore, as someone who is wanting to pursue a career in medicine I have exceptional planning and organizational skills and can help guide students into similar fields and tell them how to get involved in extracurricular such as hospital volunteering and various things on campus such as clubs and societies.  nan I am extremely driven and motivated. Academically, I strive for perfection and I think anyone can do that if they believe in their ability and are willing to learn. I suffered from anxiety for a long time because of school and I think I can help students overcome their fears and enjoy learning. nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047551740', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047627114', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047582592', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047640464', 0.97, 'mentor')]"
1047584290,"First Year JD Student at the University of Victoria's Faculty of Law | Bachelor of Arts in Psychology at Simon Fraser University (Grad 2020) nan My main career goal is to become a practicing lawyer. It is a dream I latched onto in elementary school.The closer I get to achieving that goal, the more I hear about how bad it is to be a lawyer but it is a little too late now... My career goals were mostly shaped by my sister. She is 10 years older than me and was studying to be a lawyer when I was young so I mostly followed in her footsteps. Thus, my story is quite boring when it comes to choosing a career. If I was able to pursue a career where time and money did not matter I would love to be a resort manager. Owning a resort somewhere on the coast of Vancouver Island would be a dream. You could hike, surf, snowboard, and meet tons of amazing people from around the world. When I was in high school I was not a model student. There were so many courses that I was not interested in but because I was able to figure out what programs I wanted to apply for early in high school I was able to identify the classes that I knew I had to do good in. I was extremely anxious about applying for universities so I applied to just about every school in the country. I did end up getting into my first choice school, SFU, which I chose because it was close to home and had a good reputation. Unfortunately, my dream schools was UBC but I sold myself short and did not end up applying which I deeply regret. I went right into university out of high school which I am not sure was best for me. Going straight into it gave me no time to recover from the long journey that high school was or prepare for the long journey that university would be. As a result I did not do very well in my first year. It took me five years to complete my degree anyways which is pretty typical of most students at SFU. Had I given myself a year off I might have been better prepared to do my degree in a shorter amount of time. nan I love outdoor activities like camping, fly fishing, hiking, backpacking, snowboarding, and cycling. I drive a Jeep that I love to take into the backcountry on old FSR's. I watch a ton of sports and follow the Canucks, Manchester United, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Aston Martin in F1. I also watch a ton of old and new movies and listen to a decent mix of music. I spend countless hours on youtube watching videos about gaming, TV shows, coffee, watches, shoes, cars, the list goes on... nan I have an urban background He/Him/His No preference nan I am a very anxious person and so I think I have learned very specific things about all the stuff I have experienced. Everyone is different so I do not think I can provide a blueprint about how to get through certain things but I think it is important to hear experiences, advice, and opinions from other people in order to form an idea of something. So, I have gone through high school as a middle of the pack student, I have found my way through undergrad somehow with a decent enough grade, and I have gone through the process of applying and being accepted to law school. Throughout these processes I have struggled to understand expectation and requirements, I have struggled with making new friends, and I have struggled to leave home but everything has worked out so far. Thus, I am very happy to discuss all of these experiences and how I got through them. Aside from school I have worked in retail, as an office assistant, as a receptionist, and done a bit of volunteering. Those jobs have all had their own difficulties and I am more than happy to provide some of my insight on that. nan I am very passionate about environmental protection. nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047586873', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047640464', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047631584', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047590948', 0.98, 'mentor')]"

Until my thrid year, I developed interests in psychology, particularly about counselling psychology.

With my current degree being in the apparel industry, I plan on working as a technical developer, designer, or any other job in the field of fashion. Meanwhile, I will work on my education in counselling psychology and hopefully become a clinical counsellor, social worker, or rehabilitation officer. I also have training in jewelry making, and I would like to work as a silversmith/jeweller on the side or as passion projects should job opportunities arise! I would say my dream career is any career path that allows me to connect with people and ideally in a helping profession as I find that to be the most rewarding. I am grateful for any job that would allow me to be of service to my community as I value equity and strive to devote my time to helping various underserved communities!

I've been ambitious and dedicated in pursuing this, although at times it seems tough and impossible!I've also developed an interest in research, during my current co-op placement at BC Children's Hospital. This job has taught me so much about different career paths in science and the gratification of working in a health care environment,Specifically, I've always wanted this medical/healthcare-related goal, because as typical as it sounds, I love helping others. It is such a rewarding and eye-opening experience. I also love learning about our bodies, how they work, and new types of treatments/therapies that are being discovered every day.  I began with a bachelor of science in biology, and have stuck with it since my first year at UBC.I never intended to do a co-op placement, but during my second year, I really wanted to step outside of the classroom and gain real-life experience.

1047583343,"Simon Fraser University and Faculty of Arts, majoring in History, and currently in my second year. nan My main goal is to be a History Professor. So, subsequently I would also like to be a high school history teacher on the path to becoming a history professor. I am also planning to pursue higher education such as a Masters and PhD. I'm mainly interested in East and Southeast Asian 19th and 18th century history. I did really well in history during high school and I found that learning history was something I was more interested in comparison to any other subject. I am dead set on becoming a History teacher so I am doing everything I can to pursue this by trying to gain experience being in a teaching position and be able to teach history at the same time.    Currently, I am second-year student majoring in history within the Faculty of Arts. My first choice in a post-secondary was really only SFU (Simon Fraser University), I did some research in their programs and I found myself already planning into its program, so I was knew what I was getting into and which courses to take. Also, I had already thought about going into teaching so I had already planned for SFU's Profession Development Program for teaching. In hindsight, I probably should've enrolled into other universities/colleges just in case I didn't get accepted. But before I actually got accepted into SFU, I took a gap year (my parents did not like that).I really think that taking a gap year was the best thing I've done prior to going into SFU, and I would advise others to do the same. Usually, high-school students have this impression that they need to go straight into a post-secondary right after they graduate, probably due to parental pressures or the thought that they need to finish post-secondary as fast as possible. However, I think there's some merit in taking a gap year such as working so that you can save up for tuition. Working and finding hobbies to explore what you like helps shape what kind of career you would want to pursue. Obtaining work experience is a valuable asset in future endeavors and subsequently makes it easier to obtain other jobs down the line. More importantly, it gives high-school graduates the time to really reflect on what they want to pursue and what they want in life. I've heard from friends stories of university students switching from other programs essentially wasting money and tuition because it did not end up as they thought it would be. Then, they switch to another program they finally like but at the cost of dropping out from a program they previously did not enjoy. And if anything, I think it's a well deserved break after having a majority of your life spent in school,As for my gap year, I worked and saved up money. It was my first job so earning money was the greatest thing in the world for me at that time. Eventually, I had to quit my job after 6 months because my family and I moved farther away from my workplace. nan I really like playing video games and I also like to read from time to time. Some of my favourite video games are the Dark Souls trilogy and Bloodborne. But, currently my most played game is Destiny 2. Playing games with friends are an absolute blast so I like playing with them when we all have the time. I am also reading Dune right now. I also like to watch anime too, currently I am watching Overlord season 4. I also like watching House of the Dragon which is a prequel to Game of Thrones. I also enjoyed kayaking, last time I went to Golden Ears with friends and it was really fun kayaking out on a lake. I also love ramen and whenever I go out with friends it's my only suggestion for food. I am also learning Japanese, although I am learning it by myself, so I'm self-teaching it. I also like technology and computers, so I am always interested in people building PCs. And of course, I like learning about East and Southeast Asian history.  nan I have an urban background He/Him no nan Since my major is in History, I am especially adept at writing essays and doing historical research.

Writing good notes is also a good skill to learn for studying material, and I have written a bunch of them at this point so I could also instruct them on writing good notes. I could also help them in time management and how to efficiently get work in done so as to reduce as much stress as possible when handing in assignments.  nan I was in a choir during high school (from Grade 8 all the way through Grade 12) and we went to Europe for a choir competition.

I think that if I could help develop new treatments or techniques while still having a clinical practice would be an ideal case for me. In another life, I think being a professional skydiver sounds interesting. While originally from Kelowna, I wanted to go to school in Vancouver to experience living on my own in a bigger city. I wanted to be a doctor and always loved biology, so biochemistry or microbiology seemed like the obvious choice. In first year, I enrolled in a smaller program called Science One, in hopes of having a stronger online community during zoom school. The program takes an interdisciplinary approach to the sciences, focusing on the intersections between fields. Ultimately this program and its wonderful professors helped me realize I actually love physics, which I had easily written off as my least favourite subject in high school.

1047582928,"Bachelor of Design in Graphic Design at Vancouver Island University, Year 3 nan I'm most interested in experience, interaction, and visual design. I live and breathe storytelling; I want to be in a position where I can shape how someone might experience or interact with something, especially if it's related to technology. I'm also very interested in technology and society. When I was younger, I really wanted to be a veterinarian, mostly because growing up I never got to have any pets. That decision changed the one (1) day I volunteered at a local vet clinic, and unfortunately, that was also the summer before grade 12, which meant I had to completely change my university plans. I made the (quick) decision to apply for engineering programs. I wouldn't have to do any more school after getting a Bachelor degree in engineering, right? And I had the grades and coursework for it. So, on my own, I sent applications off to Queen's University, the University of Victoria, the University of Calgary, the University of British Columbia, and McGill University. I applied to the University of Northern British Columbia's Health Science program on the off-chance I changed my mind about engineering. Applying to universities on my own was tough. My parents, being immigrants, didn't know anything about the Canadian process, and being a student at a rural high school (without an academic counsellor no less) forced me to do my own research and double (and triple) check I was meeting all the program requirements. Winter came and went, and with it, acceptances into QueensU, UVic, UCalgary, and UNBC. McGill had rejected me. UBC waitlisted me, then finally rejected me in June (no hard feelings... anymore at least).I chose UVic, and in Fall 2018, started in engineering. But I found myself unhappy, deeply unhappy. And I was upset about feeling so unhappy because I had worked so hard to be there. I tried to shoulder through my engineering courses, but found that my unhappiness remained, so I decided to try a few computer science courses. While they were a bit better, I still found myself deeply unsatisfied with what I was investing my time in. So in January 2020, I decided to take time off school and applied for Vancouver Island University's computer science program, thinking a fresh start somewhere new could help me. Fall 2020 eventually rolled around and I found that beside the pandemic, my unhappiness had compounded into something fierce. I didn't believe in what I was doing and stopped putting in the effort, so I decided to leave school again, but this time to really evaluate what it was I enjoyed doing and could create a career in. My mom suggested that I look at graphic design because I had spent a lot of my childhood doing photography and using software like Photoshop. I did enjoy that kind of stuff enough, but for whatever reason it had never occurred to me that I could make a career out of it.

1047582923,"UBC BSc (Biology) 2017-2022, UBC BSN 2022-2024 nan I have always been interested in healthcare and science, which is why I am pursing a career in nursing. While doing my Biology degree at UBC I always loved my anatomy and cell biology classes, and knew I wanted to continue learning about this. There are also many different career paths I can pursue within nursing, such as education, public health and acute care. That is something I haven't decided yet, but will have a better understanding of, as I go through the nursing program.My dream career would be medicine if I didn't have to worry about the cost and the many more years of education. I will always keep my options open, but I am currently happy with nursing. As a high school student, I enjoyed my science classes, so I decided to study science and see where that takes me. My school counsellors advised me to apply everywhere, and I applied UBC, SFU, UVIC and Langara College.  I got into all programs and decided to go to UBC because it was my first choice and it was the closest, as I would be commuting from home. After my first year, I chose the Combined Major in Science (CMS) in Biology and Earth Science, but moved to Biology in my 3rd year. I knew I was only interested in Biology classes so it made the most sense for me. I ended up taking 5 years to complete my degree because I was a  part-time student for my first 3 years. In my 4th year, I started thinking about my future after my BSc, and healthcare was what I was most interested in. I did prerequisites for both nursing and medicine but ended up applying to nursing at UBC. This was the only nursing program I applied to as it was a 2 year accelerated program, with most students already having a previous Bachelor's degree. I was accepted in May 2022, and just started the program but I already love it!  nan I enjoy watching sports such as hockey, basketball, Formula 1 and FIFA World Cup Soccer. I love the Canucks and try to see one game in person every year. I also loving watching TV shows, movies and TikTok videos.

I also love reading books, the most recent books I read were The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes and The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo.  nan I have an urban background She/ her/ hers nan nan I think I can relate and support my mentee when dealing with academic struggles in both high school and post-secondary.

I also work and volunteer a lot as a support worker with The Canuck Autism Network, VGH Emergency Room volunteer and as social visitor at a local care home. I am now able to balance all of that with school, and understand everyone is different but will always support my mentee with what they are struggling with.  nan I am a first generation Canadian, as my parents are immigrants from Punjab, India.

I became passionate about rural health issues both in Canada and internationally. I hope to be able to practice medicine in communities that are in need and travel abroad to do global health work.  After graduating highschool I took a gap year and spend it traveling and working. I started my post secondary journey at Quest University, which was my first choice. Here I was able to take courses in all different disciplines and at this point I had no idea what I wanted to do as a career. Through taking a very broad selection of courses, I was able to narrow down my interest to biology, chemistry, and health. After graduating from my undergraduate degree, I still was unsure if I wanted to go the research rout and do my PhD or if I wanted to go to medical school. I worked for a year and a half in an HIV Research Program in Vancouver and realized that my true passion was in providing hands on care to patients. I then applied for medical school at UBC after two years of trying.  nan I am really interested in anything active. I love being on the ocean, either sailing and kayaking.

1047582717,"I am a 4th year student at the University of British Columbia, studying Geology and Biology.  nan I am currently interested in a range of careers, these include being a professor, researcher and museum curator in the field of Paleontology or Geology. I truly enjoy learning and teaching others about the history of the planet, so in becoming a professor/researcher, I would be able to discover and teach others about this subject. I am also interested in museum work, as you get to work with a lot of neat specimens and help create exhibits to teach the general public. I hope my future career could combine the three I have mentioned here, to include teaching, researching and museum work in Earth Science. This would be my dream career. I think my academic background (since starting at UBC) has definitely influenced by interest in Earth science, but volunteering and working at the various museums on campus has also shaped my career goals.  In High School, I really enjoyed all the sciences, and for my future career, I wasn't sure how I was going to pick between Biology, Physics, Chemistry and Geography. When I was in grade eleven, there was a point in the school year where I was learning about waves/oscillations in Physics, oceans in Geography as well as waves in Math and Chemistry. Although it was unplanned by the teachers, I found that I could combine the knowledge from these subjects and I was quite amazed. Following this realization, I became quite interested in Earth Sciences, because I found that studying the planet actually combined all of the sciences, which was perfect for me! At that point, I decided to join the Earth Science department at the UBC (which was my first choice of program and school), and eventually major in Geology and minor in Biology.  nan I really enjoy doing arts and crafts! The actual craft I like to do typically changes from time to time, at the moment, I quite enjoy jewellery making, drawing and origami. I am also writing a geology themed comic at the moment, which has been a fun challenge! In the past, I have also liked book binding, watercolour painting and resin.I enjoy reading as well. Most of the books are read fall into two categories: 1) Non fiction science books and 2) Manga and graphic novels. Interestingly, the book I am currently reading doesn't fit into either of those categories, it is called 'Atlas of the Heart' and it is about human emotion.

1047582596,"I have attended CNC and UNBC. Always in the psychology program but added English And First Nations studies. nan I am currently designing a non-profit program that will bring free drop in counselling to my community and utilize Western and First Nation methods to mental health and spiritual well being.I am also currently writing an auto-fiction manuscript on harm reduction recovery. This self help book will incorporate my experiences, journey of personal growth and several fields of psychology offering the reader the tools they need to recover from a combination of trauma, mental illness and addiction.Although my life has not been easy, or ideal, it is the reason I have these goals today.  Honestly since I was a high school drop out, single mother and recovering addict I did not believe post secondary school was an option for me. I grew up in rural areas and in poverty, even graduating high school hadn't seemed like an option for me as I started working and was on my own very young.When I first thought about more schooling I didn't aim very high academically. I had been cooking since I was seven and so I got my GED and did Culinary Arts Levels 1 & 2 at CNC. I wasn't the best in the class but I passed and my ginger bread clock tower was celebrated. Being exposed to the college experience really got me thinking about what I had wanted to do as a child. I wanted to be a Psychologist and help people.I grew bored cooking for a living quickly and was working as a support worker with people in addiction. I found myself thinking why not? after all I survived addiction and Culinary Arts. Why not me? Why can I not achieve my dreams? So I booked an appointment with an academic advisor at CNC.The list of things I had to do was huge... placement tests, upgrading and then a huge list of classes for the psychology program. I couldn't say or spell many of the words on my to do list. Some of them I didn't even know the meaning of! I still spelt psychology wrong sometimes! It was anxiety provoking but I put my negative self talk away, ignored all of the things I believed growing up and took a chance on myself. After a placement test I decided that if I could pass the first step, the first class, I would keep going and I did. One task at a time.I completed my upgrading at CNC (repeating each math class twice), and I took first year classes while I was upgrading. By the time I was in second year classes I had been diagnosed with ADHD GAD PTSD and Bi-polar disorder. I learned how to accept and ask for help with the staff at CNC. I finished my upgrading and the classes offered at CNC before transferring to UNBC.At UNBC I utilized everything I knew from my experiences at CNC. I added English and First Nations studies to my Bachelors degree in the form of minors for a diverse degree. It was at UNBC that I finished the upper level classes of my degree and gained the confidence I need for my current passion projects.I graduated from UNBC with a Bachelors Degree in the Science of Psychology with minors in English and First Nations studies and a 3.21 GPA. Some days it still feels unbelievable because I never allowed myself to think this far ahead. I would get overwhelmed thinking about all of the classes I had to take and only focus on one semester at a time. Finishing my biggest goals in life has given me the opportunity and knowledge I need to make and achieve the new ones.   nan I have various hobbies; cooking, baking, gardening, hiking, writing, going to the range, entertaining, game nights, working out, cats and dogs, DIY projects and most recently a bit of web design.  nan I have a rural background her, she  0 nan I have experience working with people struggling with addiction and/or mental illness.I also am one of these people.I have had to learn how to overcome many barriers to mange my disabilities both personally and academically. Leaving a rural area for an urban setting is something I did as a minor and then again and an adult with different outcomes. I have utilized all of my post secondary knowledge into my daily living for things like time management, motivation and  overcoming specific obstacles.  nan I have one First Nation ancestor aways back in our family tree. Current DNA testing doesn't have a measure for FN ancestry. I acknowledge both my ancestor and 23andMe DNA testing.

However if I get too much sun in the summer I encounter a range of racism. From staff at institutions asking my band, to implying negative stereo types about Indigenous women and mothers. From men saying things like 'I usually only like white women', lateral violence and so on. Although my encounters with racism are limited It does allow for me to better understand the Indigenous experience.I wasn't really sure where I fit on the LGBTQIAP2S+ scale when I was younger.

1047582593,"University of Waterloo Math/Science Double major. Minor in Economics, Computer Science, Business. (Specialization in Bioinformatics). University of Victoria Law 2nd year  nan I will start with my most practical and realistic career goal since I am actively pursing that at the moment:- Working on public policy especially in areas relating to health, privacy, and information technology- Starting my own company developing legal technology to improve access to justice- High school teacher a bit later down the roadWhy?: ""Jack of all trades, master of none"" (at least not yet, working on it). I have found that that sentence really captures my background. The wider the breadth of your knowledge, the more you begin to notice the similarities between vastly different subjects. For example, researchers in the sciences trying to figure out a specific pathway to a biological phenomenon is not that much different from a detective trying to solve a crime. So this really culminates in my choosing of a career that could best leverage my academic background. And it turns out that public policy in healthcare, IT, involves legal and business considerations, as well as technical knowledge of which I learned about in university.Solving access to justice issues, or being a teacher is also just me trying to leverage my knowledge and expertise to become involved in a field that I care about. I think there is a lot of inefficiencies when it comes to public administration and access to justice, which makes the system that much less fair than it should be. And it makes a world of difference between a 'teacher' versus someone who is fun, passionate, and tailors the material to the class.And if I had no time constraint:- Data Scientist/Bioinformatician. Preferrably on research in personalized medicine and genetics- Legal advisor for NGO (environmental or humanitarian issues)A bit contrived, but I do want to 'make a difference' aha. And I think biopharma, climate change, and geopolitical stability are some of the most fundamental issues.Show me the money careers:- eSports/Sports owner or manager- Principal of my own school or university- Youtuber (travel, DIY, philanthropy)  Full disclosure, I aced my high school in almost every subject, and I did it without sacrificing much time outside or with friends or extracurricular activities (so not in a, dare I say it, 'nerd' way). First year university was tough because I went out of province and I didn't know anyone. Then came the second year of university, and I failed. I was given an opportunity to try again. I failed, again. I hid that fact from my parents for an entire year but eventually they did find out. And I'm not sure if you are aware of the Asian family dynamic, but it was a huuuge deal. I had never failed in anything before in my entire life and then when it mattered, I was basically kicked out of my program. But my parents were supportive, and after some really awkward and uncomfortable dinners, we got through it. I reevaluated my options and switched programs, and did very well afterwards. I ended up spending more time in uni than I would have liked, but looking back I have no regrets. I can probably spend hours going into details on my university path, but my most important takeaway is, some of your most painful failures can become some of your most valued and solid foundations going forward. And I hope the lessons I learned from my ordeal can help better prepare you in your future. nan Games: Moba (only fun with friends ha); some RTS, RPG, shooters.

Also, I am in my 2nd year law school so I can answer many questions related to this path of study as well. nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047567941', 0.96, 'mentor'), ('1047550122', 0.96, 'mentor'), ('1047551755', 0.96, 'mentor'), ('1047551740', 0.96, 'mentor')]"
1047582592,"I am currently in my 4th year at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. I will be graduating this year with a Bachelor's of Science Honours with a major in Life Sciences nan The career that I am trying to pursue is a career in medicine. This could also be viewed as a dream career, however I am hoping to make it a reality nonetheless. The reason I say this is also a dream career is because the process of applying takes a lot of time, medical school requires high grades, and there are financial barriers to overcome in order to endure the process of application. I have made a lot of sacrifices in my life in order to pursue this career and I am hoping that all my hard work will pay off. Ever since I was young, I have had the goal of pursuing a career in medicine. My interest in the field of healthcare first began when I was 5, when I had a health issue and was admitted to the hospital for surgery. Unfortunately, what is usually a low risk surgery went poorly and I ended up in the ICU. This experience led me to want to pursue a career in medicine to ensure that what happened to me doesn?t happen to others or that I can at least provide more comfort in the process that I feel I was not given. Additionally, my passion for dance has further contributed to my interest in medicine. Dance requires a lot of knowledge of the musculoskeletal system, and while growing up dancing I gained more and more interest in how the human body worked.  I have had somewhat of a traditional path to post-secondary, however I want to acknowledge that the route that I?ve taken is not necessarily for everyone and does not need to be viewed as the norm. I am in the same program that I started in, however I have had lots of friends who have switched over the years and have been so glad that they made that decision. I am currently at Queen?s University, and while I have loved my university experience, it was not my 1st choice school. As someone with an interest in pursuing medicine, I had my heart set on McMaster health science as it is often known to be a program which helps students get into medical school. After doing everything I could on my application to get in, I was rejected. I originally was crushed, as I had dreamed of attending that program for many years and thought that without that program my career goals might not be possible. I believe, however, that everything happens for a reason and I am truly thankful for where I?ve ended up. As a second choice, I chose my school due to the size and nature of the Kingston community. While it may mean I need to work harder to pursue my career at my school, I think that the small size and welcoming community of Queen?s has made my experience truly enjoyable. I have been able to make lots of friends and have been able to get involved in the community with various activities.  nan One of my main hobbies is dance. I grew up competitively dancing, and I've continued my passion at University. I teach dance to other university students, I compete on the Queen's tap team, and I'm a part of other dance related clubs. I also participate in other sports including skiing, surfing, paddle-boarding, and more. Another hobby of mine is baking. I bake all sorts of desserts including cakes, cookies, pies, and more. I also am a fan of reading, particularly fiction novels.  nan I have an urban background She/her nan nan One thing I help provide support to my mentee on is the transition from living with your family to living on your own. Before university, I lived with my family and had a lot of support from them through various aspects of my life. Leaving, and having to suddenly do everything on my own, was a big transition and one that I can help guide my mentee through. While I knew how to cook, having to plan a meal schedule and grocery shop completely for myself (and for one portion instead of a family) was quite new to me. I've learned what works for me and what doesn't and can help my mentee decide how best to navigate this aspect. Additionally, in moving far away from home, I had to learn how to build a new support system and how to leave my tight knit community. It is not always easy to go off with few friends and without your family, so I can assist my mentee in this transition. Further, with balancing school and some extracurriculars, I have learned some really effective time managing techniques that I'd be happy to share with my mentee. Also, since every person is unique in what works well for them, I'd be pleased to work with my mentee to determine what works well for them when it comes to time management.  nan While I am not technically a student athlete, I am a part of a varsity club that competes for my school. What I've taken from this experience is learning how to continue one's passions from high school when they go off to university. People often struggle when it comes to balancing sports and other extracurriculars that they were previously passionate about, and I have a lot of experience when it comes to doing so that I think is relevant to not only athletes but people with passions of all sorts.  nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047627114', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047631584', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047587166', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047640464', 0.97, 'mentor')]"
1047582591,"First year went to Langara college, then transferred to Simon Fraser University into my second year. Originally at Langara I was under Psychology, but going into SFU, I was under history. nan If grades did not matter, I want to pursue a Masters to be able to work in Heritage jobs, such as museums, art galleries, etc. But my other career goal is also to become a social studies high school teacher. My main goal regardless is I want to share history whether that is in museums, or schools. I think history is very misunderstood as a subject to learn, and I want to share my passion for the subject and to showcase how to connect that history with your own present. Personally, if I could choose a place where to work for the rest of my life, I would work in Florence, Italy, in an art gallery that features some of the most famous Italian Renaissance pieces.  In high school I wanted to study Psychology and applied at Langara college and got accepted into their program. Turns out, after taking AP Psychology in Grade 12, I realized it wasn't for me. I chose to do my first year at Langara because I was scared about the transition going from high school to university. Financially, college is a cheaper alternative to university, and a smart one in my opinion to begin with if desired. I was told I did a dumb mistake while applying from high school to go to college with the high grades I had, but I don't regret my decision at all. As the old saying goes, ""everything is possible"". During my first year at Langara College under the psychology department, there I found a massive interest in history, and art history, so even if you start out in one department, it is okay to have a change of heart. Then, trying to get into Simon Fraser University in 2020 for my second year, I kept my grades as high as possible and got accepted! My luck however may not be the same for others, but I think I am a good example showcasing that you can go into college and university with success.  nan I'll be perfectly honest, I never know what to say what my interests are. Despite that, I would say that I love art (acrylic painting, film photography, illustrations), I like to read (usually summer break is when I read the most), and I like to be outdoors (hiking, casual biking, swimming in lakes and seas, etc.)! If traveling wasn't expensive, I would also include travel (especially to my family's home country).  nan I have an urban background she/her 0 nan I first started post-secondary with two jobs, I was a banquet server, and a part-time associate at Winners. It was very chaotic, and I don't recommend it even to my worst enemy. Then COVID hit, and I only maintained my job at Winners. I think figuring out a work-life-school balance is very difficult, but once you have an idea on how to sustain it and not give up, you feel a type of success. That being said, it is very tough, and I regret not starting therapy or counselling earlier about my stresses. It helps a ton!! Especially if counselling can be provided by the post secondary institution you go to, I say go for it. Life becomes easier enough to breathe through whatever your stress is. But my number one advice is to take time for yourself whether that is having a small workout, walk, draw, read, etc. I think when I started to do that, my outlook began to change, and with that, my motivation too.  nan I am an only child, so growing up and having my parents separate at a young age, formed struggles and questions that sometimes I still don't have answers to. I found that not having answers to everything is for the best no matter how hurtful, and in the end, I tell myself I'll make a better life out of those struggles I faced. Through that time, I found passions through supporting important social justice causes, dance, and so much more. Unfortunately I am not a good athlete, but I do love supporting sports!! My soccer teams I cheer for is the Croatian National Soccer team, and the UEFA team, Dinamo Zagreb. Since I do live in Canada, I obviously enjoy watching hockey too. In terms of music my palette is all over the place, despite that, I often find myself listening to U2 and old-timey music, as well as 80's Balkan hits (if you know, you know.).  nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047583343', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047514156', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047587166', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047640464', 0.98, 'mentor')]"

1047582323,"University of Waterloo, Geological Engineering, Co-op program, 2017-2022. University of British Columbia, Masters of Applied Science in Geological Engineering, 2022-2024 (hopefully). nan I am interested in careers in hydrogeology and geochemistry (the interaction of water and rocks). Specifically, I am interested in the remediation, or clean up, of contaminated mine water. When water leaves a mine, it contains a lot of different chemicals that can destroy the environment or make humans really sick. I want to treat this water to prevent that. I like doing field work, where I actually go to mine sites, often in northern communities, and perform tests on the water. While I am young, I want to do a lot of field work and travel with my job. Once I am older, I plan to have a job where I work in an office, which doesn't require a lot of travelling for work. If time, money and grades didn't matter, my dream job would be stocking shelves at a grocery store. I think one day I may do this part time as I really enjoy organizing and find it satisfying to stock groceries. My background had very little to do with my career goals. No one in my family is an engineer. I didn't like rocks more than most kids growing up. But when it came down to choosing a career path, I realized I wanted the opportunity to be outside for work and not be stuck at a desk. As I got older (high school), I really liked to be outside and go exploring (running, hiking and camping). Many of my friends helped me to realize that I liked the outdoors and would want a career that involved some aspect of field work. When choosing my program, I was completely lost. I took a lot of science and math courses in high school and seemed to excel in these subjects (I wasn't great at English). Many of my friends, family members and teachers told me about engineering and how I would likely be a good fit, however I didn't know much about what engineering was. About a week before applying to university, I still had no clue what program to study so my friend and I started reading descriptions of the various engineering types. All of them sounded too hard or I couldn't see myself doing work in that field, except for the geological engineering program. It had a strong emphasis on field work and hands on learning and I knew that I liked the sounds of that. So I decided to apply. I applied to two school, University of Waterloo and University of Western Ontario. Waterloo was appealing to me because it was approximately 2 hours from my hometown and I wanted some distance from my family so that I could develop the skills to be independent. Also, my dad went to the University of Waterloo. After completing an interview and receiving my acceptance letter from the University of Waterloo, I officially accepted my offer. Following my undergrad, which had 6 co-op opportunities, I thought about my favourite co-ops, which were working for a research group within the university. From this experience, and not really knowing what to do next, I decided to pursue my Master degree at the University of British Columbia. nan I am a runner, mostly long distances. I ran cross country in high school and for the University of Waterloo. The longest race I have done to date is a 30km race but I am signed up for a marathon which will take place in January. My preferred race distances are the 10km and the half marathon. I love being outside, especially walking or hiking. I do some downhill skiing but I'm not really good (plus I am slightly afraid of heights so this can be quite challenging). I really enjoy baking, especially cookies (which I also love eating)! I have recently started making muffins and bread. While in elementary school and high school, I danced both recreationally and competitively (tap, jazz, ballet, lyrical, musical theater, hip hop). I also taught dance. nan I have an urban background She/her nan nan I was very shy growing up (and still can be) so I'd love to share some of my experiences with dealing with this and explaining the opportunities that I have missed or had. For example, I did not want to reach out to the cross country coaches at UWaterloo, but after 3 years of school I finally did which helped me make some great friends, offered a lot of support and brought me many opportunities that I wouldn't have otherwise had. Time management is also something I can provide assistance with as it was very difficult to learn without support. Understanding that self-care is important was not something I knew in my first year of school. I was constantly doing school work and didn't make time for myself. Learning how to manage my time and schedule out some time for myself helped me make it through the rest of my undergrad. Living independently is also something I can support my mentee with. I had a unique experience of having my first co-op term after 4 months of school. I was sent to live in a different city, away from the friends that I just made. I thought that I had to be alone to be independent but learned that independence still requires you to talk to friends and family (you do not have to be lonely to be independent, people will not be annoyed with you for asking questions to learn what to do).  nan I was a varsity cross country runner for the University of Waterloo. At UBC, I am running for the club cross country team.  nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047590921', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047640464', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047590948', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047582591', 0.97, 'mentor')]"
1047582235,"I began at UBCO and finished my BA there. I am currently studying at UBC's Allard School of Law for my JD.  nan Currently my likely prospective career(s) remain in the general field of law. Nearly a decade of post-secondary school sunk into a law degree makes for quite a sunk cost to simply change fields at this point. More specifically I am looking at a career in dispute resolution outside of the court system. 

Were money not an issue I would strongly consider being a career parent.  Post-secondary was always expected of me. I was a ""bright"" child and excelled at math in elementary school. Even as my academic excellence waned in high school and my disinterest in academics became more apparent I was funneled into studying at the local university: UBCO. Initially I entered UBCO intending to study psychology but switched to philosophy about half way through my degree. I took summer classes all through my undergraduate program, took less than a full course load through most of the program, and ended up taking an extra semester. Even now in my JD program I took a summer course, am taking less than a full course load and will take an extra semester. In between my two degrees I spent nearly a year working in an office and pursuing my hobbies, until health orders required the shutdown of said hobbies at which point I was counting the days until I could move away for my next stint at university. Now, 18 months from being done (sort of) I am counting the days until I finish and rejoin the regular world outside of academia.  nan I currently ballroom dance as well as a handful of other partner dances. I also play soccer outdoors and both cards and board games indoors. I do resistance training and try to add running into my workout regime every few months: with little success. 
Previously I also did choreo dances (hip-hop, jazz, ballet, etc) as well I used to sing in a few choirs and played trumpet in a few bands. I used to also play dungeons and dragons but have since been unable to coordinate a group to play.
Growing up I was regularly in the outdoors quadding, hunting, camping, shooting, kayaking, and generally enjoying nature. I was also an avid reader of fantasy and YA novels. nan I have a rural background he/him/his nan nan I can empathize with overbearing parents, struggling to find ways to express independence while living with one's parents, and familial struggles at home. I also empathize with not fitting in at school and extra-curriculars and much of the negativity that comes with that. I have long struggled with time management, and still often do, as well as issues surrounding motivation to engage with the work ""required"" by school. I can also speak to many struggles surrounding moving out: both expected and unexpected struggles. I can also speak to the crash felt when, for whatever reason, grades start to fall after having one's identity wrapped up in being ""the smart kid."" I understand what it is like to struggle with certain addictions, mental issues, and managing finances. nan While not a ""student athlete"" officially, I have engaged in athletics at intramural and rec-league levels intermittently throughout my time at university. I have also competed in international competitions as a dancer while studying at university.   nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047640121', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047589084', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047640464', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047585820', 0.97, 'mentor')]"
1047582077,"I currently attend the University of British Columbia (UBC) as a third year Psychology major minoring in Interpersonal Development. Before I transferred to UBC I attended Douglas College, and later SFU, also as a Psychology major. nan I plan to enrol in a Master's program that will allow me to work as a registered Clinical Counsellor. This means I will be providing therapy to individuals with mental health issues to give them tools to help manage their symptoms and lead happy, healthy lives. I think it would be a privilege to get to work with individuals with mental health problems to improve their day-to-day lives. Mental health is detrimental to your well-being, after all! Becoming a registered Clinical Counsellor has not always been my career goal. I was initially hesitant to enter into the arts and social sciences because I had heard that you can't make much money, or that it was an ""easy out"" compared to entering the sciences. After talking to university students majoring in psychology (and with much encouragement from my friends) I decided that arts and social sciences was where I wanted to be! Through these conversations with students in the program I wanted to enrol in, and conversations with my friends, I gained confidence that my educational journey is just that: a journey unique to me. I learned that you CAN make money and be successful in the arts field, and that it's all about taking advantage of the opportunities available to you! If time, money, and grades didn't matter, however... I would definitely be a marine biologist. I love watching marine ecosystem documentaries on Netflix, and exploring coastlines local to me. Spending my days investigating the little creatures in a tidal pool would be a dream! My path to post-secondary started at a community college local to me, Douglas College. I chose Douglas College because it offered smaller class sizes, which provided an opportunity for me to adjust from high school to post-secondary without the stress of huge crowds. Having smaller classes also meant I could easily network with my professors and peers, as it's much easier to get to know your professor in a college class of 25 compared to a university auditorium of 250! I chose to transfer to Simon Fraser University in my second year because I was interested in some of their research laboratories. For students in psychology who are interested in applying to graduate school, research experience is an asset, and this was not offered at the college I started out with. (There are also other opportunities to gain experience outside of research, but research was also an interest of mine!). My original plan after Douglas College was to transfer to the University of British Columbia (UBC) after 1st year, but I was not accepted into the program I wanted. Though I was initially disappointed, I took this as an opportunity to immerse myself in the research labs at Simon Fraser that differ from the ones I was expecting to join at UBC. I also got to meet new individuals I would not have met had I gone to UBC right away! As luck turned out, I was accepted into UBC for my 3rd year (2023/24). So, as of May 2023, I'll have been enrolled in 3 post-secondary institutions! nan In my spare time I enjoy reading, frequenting local hikes/beaches, trying out new cafes, and hanging out with my two cats. When reading, I gravitate towards magical surrealism (best authors are absolutely Haruki Murakami or Sabrina Imbler) and interesting autobiographies. My all time favourite book changes frequently, but as I write this, ""How Far The Light Reaches"" by Sabrina Imbler or ""On Early We're Briefly Gorgeous"" by Ocean Vuong comes to mind. I currently volunteer as a Research Assistant for the PHASE Lab at UBC, and as a Crisis Responder for the KidsHelpPhone.I also love learning about the ocean and its many ecosystems, outer space, and dinosaurs. I've seen just about all of the documentaries on these subjects available on Netflix. In high school, I had the opportunity to go to the Bamfield Marine Science Center on Vancouver Island, where I saw bioluminescent plankton glow in the ocean. If you ever have the chance to observe this, I can attest it's absolutely worth it!  nan I have an urban background They/She nan nan Starting post-secondary school, I didn't know many people at my college, and those I did were acquaintances and not in any of my classes. I've navigated classes without friends and also had classes where I initially didn't know anyone, but finished with great new pals! Because of this, I consider myself equipped to support mentees about concerns about the social environmental of a new school.Time management was something I struggled with my first semester of college, but now consider myself a master scheduler. Through trial-and-error, and I have found a system that seems to work for me. I would be happy to help my mentee in finding a system to help them stay organized for school and other obligations.I also have experience as a transfer student. By this, I mean that the institution I started post-secondary at is not the one I will be completing my degree at. My experience at a smaller community college allowed me to explore my interests while saving money on tuition, and provided a more gradual introduction to post-secondary. At my first college, I took a course on dinosaurs, just for fun! I also have experience volunteering for the KidsHelpPhone as a crisis responder. Though there are age restrictions on volunteering, I would love to share my experiences in this role to mentees interested in getting involved with this organization in the future!! nan I identify openly as queer.

1047581892,"I am currently a fourth-year student majoring in Applied Animal Biology in the faculty of Land and Food Systems at the University of British Columbia. I transferred here in my second year; I initially went to the University of Waterloo in Ontario where I was enrolled in the Honours Health Studies program. nan I plan on becoming a secondary school biology teacher! I found that while I was in high school, there were certain teachers who really made my experience the best that it could be, and I want to return that gesture for my own future students. I�m also considering a career in the psychology field or obtaining a Masters degree in Library Science - I�ve taken many undergraduate psychology courses which I found super interesting and would love working in that area, and this past year I worked at a library on-campus that I really enjoyed and could also foresee a career in for myself. My path to post-secondary is a bit of a complicated one. In Grade 12, I had my entire life planned out, from each course I would take in every year in my undergrad to which medical schools I would apply to. I was 100% set on becoming a doctor, and my dream school was McMaster University in their Health Sciences program. My plan was thrown off when I received a rejection letter from them, and so I accepted the school that I had listed as my second choice: the University of Waterloo, where I studied Honours Health Studies. I quickly found that medical school wasn�t the right path for me because I wasn�t passionate about any of my health-related classes, and so I started to think more about what I really cared about rather than what I thought I 'should' do. I�ve always had a strong love for animals, and so I decided to make the move across the country to study Applied Animal Biology at the University of British Columbia (UBC), which I am in the process of completing this year. I chose to study at UBC because it was one of the only schools in Canada that offered an animal biology program that aligned with my interests. Throughout the past three years, I�ve thought about pursuing veterinary science, working in a zoo or a conservation area, or finding a career in an animal shelter. I�ve finally settled on something almost unrelated to my degree - teaching. Its been quite the journey with a lot of difficult moments, but without these hardships I never would have found where my true passions lie! nan I love to play video games, watch anime/read manga, and play piano in my free time!

1047581869,"UBC Microbiology and Immunology nan I have been pursuing medicine ever since I made the decision when I was 9 years old. I've always been a highly curious person, and from that, stemmed a huge satisfaction with learning. I was (and still currently am) the type of person to pick up new things frequently. I think its one of the key qualities that I possess, and it's also the one that I'm most proud of. Viewing the world through a curious lens led me towards the sciences, as more often than not, the questions that I asked were answered through scientific concepts.  Currently I'm studying microbiology and immunology, and I love learning about diseases and how our body responds to it. Viruses and bacteria have always intrigued me, and the immune system is the coolest thing I have ever studied.  I was already keen on attending university ever since elementary school, as my brother was an undergraduate at the time. Throughout highschool, I developed an interest in microbiology thanks to my biology 11 honours teacher. She had also majored in microbiology and immunology at UBC and acted as a large influence on what I chose to major in. Unfortunately I was not accepted into my first-choice school (McMaster), so I decided to attend UBC instead due to its convenience. I want to stress that I was not always a good student. In fact my report cards in elementary until about halfway through highschool were mainly C's and N work ethics. Academics is something you can definitely improve on, given time and dedication. nan I play piano, acoustic and electric guitar, and am currently learning the bamboo flute. I was also looking to buy an electronic drum set if they ever went on sale. I have a huge passion for music and enjoy learning multiple instruments. When I have time I like transcribing songs onto guitar. I play a lot of sports/work out and usually go to drop-ins every now and then, or I just make a plan with friends and setup on a field somewhere. I've been playing table tennis and golf for 12 years or so now, but I also play badminton, volleyball, archery, ultimate, and tennis.

1047581720,"I'm a biology major currently attending UBC. nan Either a career in medicine or dentistry is appealing to me. Since I began volunteering at a dental clinic in my 11th grade year , I have continued to be fascinated by teeth.  It is a complete fallacy that we believe our teeth are the least significant aspect of us and require the least amount of maintenance. You risk serious injury if you don't properly care for your teeth. A good smile is also a great confidence booster.  I want to pursue a career in dentistry because of this. Since I used to visit my uncle at the hospital he operated in India when I was younger, and I really admired how passionate and confident he seemed while caring for his patients. Aside from improving your self-esteem and social relationships, helping others is also a highly humbling and fulfilling experience. That is why I would really like to pursue a career as a physician. I applied to several schools, but UBC was always my primary choice because it continuously ranks among the top medical schools worldwide. It was an obvious choice for me because I want to work in medicine. The fact that UBC was the last school I had heard from made it a nerve-wracking experience. I had been accepted to every school I had applied to by the time I had graduated from high school, with the exception of UBC, they were last to accept me. Prior to applying to medical school, it seemed logical to me to major in biology. In addition, the majority of the requirements for medical schools coincided with the biology major. nan Reading has always been my escape, and I adore it. It broadens my horizons and transports me to new places. It has taught me to respect and value various different perspectives and beliefs. I also enjoy experimenting with new recipes. They don't always turn out to be the best-tasting things in the world, but it is a lot of fun to try new flavors and discover the varied ways that various cultures prepare the same ingredients. nan I have an urban background she/ her No nan By demonstrating effective coping skills and reassuring the mentee that they are not alone and should not be afraid to ask for help, I believe I may be of guidance. My mother experienced severe depression while I was in 9th grade, leaving just my mum, my younger sister (who is six years younger than I am), and I live in Canada at the time without my father (he was in India). Due to my mother's health issues, there were times when it was difficult to do anything since she would not get out of bed, eat, or move. At that time, I had to manage my entire household, my sister, and my mother on my own while attending class and maintaining my grades. It seemed like the toughest thing to accomplish at the time, and I had no idea how to ask for assistance. It was incredibly difficult and lonely, which is why I want to encourage my mentee to ask for assistance in any circumstance and to remember that they are not alone and shouldn't be hesitant to ask for help.I had previously volunteered with younger kids in grades 1-8 at Khalsa School Camp. Since it was a religious camp, I was there to educate the children on the significance and history of the Sikh religion as well as to answer any questions they may have had. I also had the opportunity to teach the kids who had never learned Punjabi before. Additionally, I've also worked as a volunteer at a care home called Suncreek Village, where I got to interact with residents, keep them company, and entertain them.  nan I come from an immigrant family and was born in Amritsar, Punjab, India. For the first 12.5 years of my life, I was raised there. It was difficult to change various aspects of my life that had been ingrained in me from birth, whether it be cultural, educational, or language.

During their time working in rural BC as well as in the city, I saw how important it was for communities to have stable access to healthcare providers and health resources. Right now, I know I am interested in continuing my career in healthcare, but I�m not quite sure which direction it may go just yet. A few career areas I have considered and looked into include health care providers (nursing, dentistry, medical school), software development, and health policy development. I�d be happy to explore other careers with my mentee and I hope that my experiences so far can help in that process, regardless of what we try and explore! My dream career (if time, money and grades didn�t matter) would likely be investigative journalism. I think it�s an exciting field with very fulfilling work, and funnily enough, it also pulls aspects from my childhood dreams of writing and being a spy. Alternatively, becoming an astronaut is another dream career from my childhood that I still hold on to today.  As I was finishing up high school, I was very unsure on where I would end up. I was looking at programs in the sciences, but within that broad category I considered very different fields including aerospace engineering, life sciences, and computer science. I ended up picking general sciences and a school that was close to my home. By second year, I did not end up taking the major I was initially pursuing and even after that I made a number of changes to my degree. I picked Integrated Sciences as it allowed me to balance aspects from different majors I was interested in, and I hoped that flexibility would let me get the most from my degree. While my official degree integration was Physiology & Immunology, I took a wide variety of courses and in my upper years I focussed on neurobiology, biomechanics (how living things move and interact with the world), and bacteriology (study of bacteria). After graduating and working for one year, I started my current second degree computer science program where, in addition to computer science courses, I�m also taking a number of courses centred around public health and bioinformatics (software used in areas related to biology).  nan I love listening to music, and often I'll have something playing while I'm working on other things. In my free time, I watch a lot of movies and TV, usually going through a few shows at once. I enjoy exploring new areas outside, and I like to spend evenings exploring the city when possible. One interest that I really liked exploring throughout post secondary was astronomy. I love star gazing, and it�s been lots of fun learning about telescopes and astrophotography. I enjoy hiking and playing soccer, and love recently gotten into climbing. love also been working on having a more consistent fitness schedule by going on runs and going to the gym.

I know what it�s like feeling very uncertain about what career path to pursue, and I hope I can share some of my strategies for dealing with that process. Similarly, I can lend an ear and hopefully offer some help to other things students may be dealing with during these transitions, such as changing friendships, adulting, or even just managing your time.

1047567862,"Bachelor of Arts in English and German (University of Alberta, graduate), Master of Library and Information Studies (UBC, second year) nan I have worked and volunteered with different non-profits dedicated to literacy and have always loved working with people! That's how I found myself really connecting with public librarianship. I was able to work at a public library this past summer as a programmer, and absolutely fell in love with it. I was honestly really surprised by how much I enjoyed working with youth and kids and I really hope that I can be a full time programmer one day. I would also love to work for any non profit organization dedicated to English language education, literacy, and encouraging reading. I have also considered being a teacher or even working in a museum or at a university and might even look into that one day. But I think that being a public librarian is, for real, my dream job so I am extremely happy that I've found it and am on track to get there! I've changed my mind a lot on my way through post-secondary. I started my Arts degree at the University of Alberta with a major in Political Science and quickly discovered that it wasn't for me. I sort of stumbled into languages by accident, as I had taken German in high school and really enjoyed it and done well. From there, I started taking French courses as well as a certificate in translation studies, but I really struggled in French and found I didn't love it as much as I loved German and some of the English classes that I had taken for fun.In my fourth year, I finally changed to a double major in English and German and it really felt right. I finished my degree in 5 years, with a lot of extra credits, but I think it goes to show how you sometimes don't know what you want to do until you've tried it!For a long time, I thought that I was going to be a translator. I looked into Masters and progressional programs, but quickly discovered that I wouldn't be able to make much of a living translating German poetry into English and would probably end up doing more technical work (like instruction manuals, policies, or legal work) and it didn't feel like it was for me. I took a gap year before I applied to library studies programs and in this time, I volunteered at various literacy organizations, took some training to become an English as a second language teacher, and worked for the Boys and Girls Club running a program for teens. I really couldn't make up my mind about what I wanted to do!I became interested in working in libraries precisely because I really didn't know what I wanted. The Master of Library and Information Studies degree is extremely versatile, and I really liked that it would give me a ticket to really explore my options and try out different careers throughout my life. It's a more of a professional than academic program that teaches you really concrete and usable skills to work in the information/library studies field. I like that I feel like what I'm learning will help me in my career, and I definitely noticed how useful it was during my summer job at a public library this summer. I am just finishing my last year of university, probably forever, and I'm really proud of how far I've come and how many different things I've been able to try (and even fail at!) It's important to step outside of school, with volunteer and work experience to really narrow in on what you love and I cannot emphasize enough how this is helped me as I tried to navigate the post-grad world and figure out what to do with an English degree. nan I love reading and writing!

This has allowed me to join and take part in many different activities since a young age. My curiosity for exploring new things and facing new challenges resulted in me joining martial arts and soccer clubs. I have been doing these two sports for over a decade now; I am currently playing soccer for my club�s men�s team, while also continuing martial arts as a black belt. My journey in both of these activities reflects the determined and dedicated individual I am. Additionally, living in North Vancouver from such a young age has also allowed me to appreciate and respect nature, something that I believe is overseen in many other parts of the world. I cherish the moments I have when I am out on hikes or meditating in the beautiful green parks. Much of my active and caring personality is due to the way I raised in a loving family and amongst the beautiful North Shore nature. My friends, family and members of my community would describe me as an ambitious, passionate, and persevering individual who does not back down from an unclaimed challenge. Many of these qualities are why I am studying Microbiology and Immunology at UBC with future desires of becoming a healthcare professional. I love the fast-paced, challenging, and mysterious settings that hospital doctors work in. I want to help individuals in any way possible, and I believe that becoming a healthcare profession would be a very fulfilling job. On the other hand, my dream career ever since I was young has been to become a professional soccer player. I love the sport so much and I believe that this would be an amazing career for the active lifestyle I currently live. If I could describe my path to university with one word it would be: cherishable. My high school experience was similar to many other students growing up in North Vancouver. I was a part of different sports activities and volunteer positions, while also keeping up with my studies and doing the hobbies I truly enjoyed. The memories I created in high school are ones that I have held closely to date. Additionally, I always knew I wanted to become a healthcare professional, but I never knew what I wanted to study to get me there. It was in grade 12 when I finally decided to study some sort of health sciences. I decided to apply to UBC because it was close to home and it also offered me an extra year of studying general sciences before I would have to declare my major. Through the hard work I completed during my grade 11 and 12 years, I was accepted into UBC during the February of 2021. To date, I have stuck with the Faculty of Science, and I am on path of finishing a bachelor in Microbiology and Immunology. I will forever cherish the path that I am currently seeking. I value the education I am obtaining, and I also value all the individuals I have met to date. The memories I have made will stay with me for the rest of my life.  nan I have many different hobbies! My favorites include: playing soccer, doing kickboxing, taking photos, playing video games (mostly COD, Valorant, and FIFA), paddle boarding in different lakes, and biking. I have also tried to begin painting, though I am not very good at it yet :). When I am with my friends, we love to hangout at the mall or visit new restaurants and food places around time. I'd love to chat about any of the above! nan I have an urban background He/Him nan nan Besides the help I can provide with educational advice and other post-secondary paths, I believe that I can also help mentees develop strong time management, communication, and test-taking skills.

I can offer a warm and comforting environment for anyone with questions.  nan I am a friendly individual who is eager to help answer any questions and give advice on life after high school. I have been a student-athlete my entire life and I believe that balancing sports and school has been a key part of my life.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Nursing at Douglas College in Lower Mainland BC. My dream career is to become a Family Doctor to help better the lives of patients of all ages. My path to my post-secondary school wasn't linear or straightforward. I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to do after graduating High School. Like many students, I also switched my program multiple times until I was finally introduced to nursing through a family friend at my local college. After being introduced to the program, I did more research into this career path and was amazed at how broad their scope of practice and approach to medical care is. Moreover, I realized that nursing plays an integral role in promoting health, preventing illness, and caring for all individuals.  nan I love playing sports outdoor, spending time with friends and family, binge watching anime, and playing video games with my siblings.

This past summer, however, I graduated from UBC with a bachelor's degree in political science and a minor in philosophy. nan I want to be a lawyer! I have been working towards this goal for many years now. I want to become one because it is challenging, there are plenty of smart people to meet, and it opens many pathways to helping my community. I would also be the first of of my family and relatives to become one. My grades in high school were well below average! I took a few months after graduating high school in June to figure out what I wanted to do. I finished my associate degree at a college after exploring my interests. I earned a two-year certificate with a specialization in political science, and then transferred over to UBC. After a bunch of law school applications, I was fortunately accepted by the University of Victoria. nan I like working out, watching anime, reading books, spending time with my family, and listening to music.

I can also help talk about things such as learning disabilities or chronic health conditions - these are things that I have managed since I was a teenager! Like I mentioned before too, I was not a star student in high school, but things have ended up pretty good so far for me. In terms of financial hardship, during my first year of pursuing my degree, I worked full-time in a very high-paced fine-dining restaurant in downtown Vancouver. It was tough and required me to be very aware of my time management, but it was definitely worth it. Overall, I have lived a life I am very grateful for and have a lot of practical experience and knowledge that I am open to sharing! nan The life experiences that have shaped me so far have been taking a proactive approach to my mental health, figuring out how to better manage my time spent on academics, and trying to figure out the direction I want my life to go towards. Growing up as a first-generation college student and the son of an immigrant family introduced many new parts of life I had to adapt to. Overall, the things I am most proud of in my life have been overcoming challenges and remaining accountable for myself and my loved ones.

1047567624,"I�m a fourth-year Bachelor of Arts student at UBC, where I study English Literature and History. nan In the future, I'm hoping to become a high school teacher! Growing up, I've always loved reading, and this has definitely led me to the subjects I chose to study at university and the career path I'd like to follow. I was very lucky to have teachers and family members who were kind and supportive of my interests, in addition to being good communicators. When I think back to the positive experiences I had as a younger student, I hope that by becoming a teacher I can learn to guide and support others as my teachers once did for me! I also grew up an only child, so school was a really important place for me to interact with people my age and to make friends, and as I teacher I would want to make my classroom a place where students feel comfortable and safe to do so as well. While studying subjects like English and History might not always be a breeze, I find that I learn best by sharing ideas and telling stories: this is really another reason why I'd like to become a teacher, as I enjoy working with others and I believe I'd learn plenty from my future students, too. I already mentioned my love for reading, but I also love creating and appreciating different types of art. Even though I decided years ago that I wanted to become a high school teacher, I've also always dreamed of working in a creative field as an illustrator, a writer, or even a fashion designer! I'd also love to work at an art gallery or museum someday. In high school, I was interested in lots of different subjects, like visual arts, psychology, history, geography, and literature. I was able to take classes in these subjects in high school and this helped my transition to university because I knew which topics I wanted to explore and I had gotten some transfer credits from Advanced Placement classes. During my time in high school, I also helped out in clubs that were helped promote the arts, which was great because I had the chance to advertise events, help publish students' artwork, and participate in dance performances. Since I was interested in graphic design, photography, and writing, I also helped out with the yearbook and the school newspaper. I find that my experiences in high school helped my communication skills, and I learned that I wished to have a job where I would work with other people. I've lived in the Lower Mainland my whole life, and I remember when I first visited the UBC Vancouver campus as a Grade 8 student when I was participating in a science fair. I remember loving the campus and thinking it was beautiful, and that was definitely one of the reasons why I chose to apply to UBC! I graduated from high school in 2020, and because of the pandemic, I began my studies at UBC completely online. I took a lot of interesting courses, but I really loved what I had read and learned about in my English and History classes, so I chose an English Literature program and a minor in History. As I said before, I'd love to be able to teach these subjects to high school students in the future, so after finishing my undergraduate degree I'd like to enter a teacher education program. nan I've always had plenty of hobbies, and many of them are creative ones! I love reading, drawing, painting, photography, and writing fiction. I have also tried sewing and knitting, too. With my family, I especially enjoy cooking, baking, and gardening. For years, I took dance classes, and my favourite type of dance is ballet. I'm into art and fashion as well, and I can spend whole days window shopping, visiting art galleries, and checking out exhibits at museums.  nan I have an urban background She/Her/Hers nan nan Based on my experiences, I can give advice about studying, joining clubs and participating in extracurricular activities, preparing for university, time management, managing stress and academic struggles, interpersonal relationships, and living on your own. I have experience as a classroom assistant at a high school. Most of the time I helped out in Learning Support Services classrooms, where the environment was relaxed and the teachers and I focused on offering one-on-one support for students who had alternative learning needs, as well as students from various backgrounds, including international students and Indigenous students. I would tutor students in English, Social Studies, French, Career Education, and sometimes Geographical Science or Biology. Even though I helped them with schoolwork, I'd also chat with students about their interests or struggles. I found that we had many things in common, and I've always understood how important it is for teachers to be good listeners and to try to get to know students at an individual level.  nan A little bit more about myself: I was born in the Greater Vancouver area and I have always lived there, and I am East Asian. My parents moved to Canada when they were kids, so I am familiar with different East Asian cultures and I went to school in a diverse area. I can speak French since I was in a French immersion program during elementary school, and I continued to take French classes during high school. nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047582324', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047587166', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047550061', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047551505', 0.97, 'mentor')]"

In addition, I am always timely with my responses, as my work involves communicating with multiple people in a timely fashion throughout the day, where responses are expected within 15 min. I always start off my day going through my notifications and emails to determine what needs to be responded to immediately, so I am never late to respond. Previously, I also mentored a first year student through Facebook Messenger and always ensured that I helped him as soon as possible by keeping my notifications on. In addition, I find it really easy to fit Zoom meetings in after work and on weekends and am really adept at using Zoom due to me utilizing it everyday at work. nan Currently, I am looking to go into medical school or graduate school after I graduate. I have always loved physics and math so I am definitely considering pursuing it further through a masters degree and maybe even eventually a doctorate degree. Afterwards, I?m not so sure yet, but I am considering positions in industry as well as academia. I?ve also recently found a love for coding, so I have been looking into computer related jobs, and am currently in a computer-related co-op position. However, as I mentioned before, I am also applying for medical school. I?ve always loved helping people, and though I major in physics, I have always been really good at biology so I would love to use my strengths to benefit others.  I actually applied to many Canadian and American undergraduate programs, but ultimately chose UBC due to its proximity to my home (Calgary!) and the lower cost of tuition compared to some other major Canadian universities. As mentioned above, I started out in the Combined Honours math and physics degree, but eventually switched to the Honours Physics degree as I found some of the math courses to be slightly too difficult. Unfortunately, I failed a course during my third year so I had to switch to just the normal Physics degree, but the flexibility of this new program has made it really worthwhile as I can now explore my newfound interest in coding as well! nan I would have to say my biggest hobby is gaming. I just finished my first playthrough of Xenoblade 3 and would love to discuss with any fellow Xenoblade fans! I've played through numerous Nintendo Switch games and would love to give recommendations for anyone interested. Outside of gaming, I enjoy hiking, swimming, playing badminton and volleyball. I also play a really cool instrument called the Chinese zither or guzheng, which basically looks like a harp if you laid it down flat and played it with guitar nails.

However, I was able to find an amazing friend group as well as numerous people who have supported me along my path, and I hope to be able to do the same for others. I can also say I am extremely knowledgeable in the medical school application process if anyone needs any assistance!I'm not sure if this would be super relevant for anyone, but if there's anyone interested in what I've worked and volunteered in, here's a condensed list!- Math and reading instructor- Course design - Open Science specialist- a bunch of tutoring volunteer positions - performing music at cultural events, old folks' homes, etc.- volunteering at the hospital  nan I was the Womens singles player on my high school badminton team and did well in city championships every year.

I haven't completely closed the door on this career yet, but for now I am going to focus on public health and should I still want to pursue medicine after my degree then I can still use my MPH degree as a physician. My background in biology exposed me to a lot of different careers in the healthcare field through my professors and my co-op job at the hospital.

Many of the people I met through my job had a public health degree and that's what sparked my interest!  A dream career if nothing else mattered would probably be an actress haha!  My path to post-secondary was very gruelling because I went to high school in Alberta where we had diploma exams in grade 12 that counted for 50% of our entire grade for that course.

Prior to medical school, I completed my B.Sc at UBC (2019). I was in the Integrated Sciences program, where I was able to build my own degree, integrating the disciplines of Microbiology and Global Health.  In the time between earning my B.Sc and starting medical school  (Sept 2019-Aug 2021),  I worked as a Math and Science tutor, and as a bookkeeper. I also worked in a biochemistry lab (Nov. 2020- March 2021).     Year-round I like to do pilates and boulder (so far only indoors, I plan on venturing outside this summer). In the winter months, I am an avid snowboarder. In the summer, I love to slalom water ski, go ATVing, and camp (usually outside of Cache Creek).  Outside of sports,  I enjoy travelling (especially abroad),  watching movies (horror and thriller are my favourite genres),  and doing the daily Wordle.  far from other towns/cities (like yours!) nan she/her/hers no preference.  1 nan I hope that by being mentor, I will be able to provide insight, guidance, and motivation to my mentee.

That being said, I have learned how to navigate post secondary and medical school applications with no guidance.

Currently, I am in my 4th year, but on a co-op working at BC Children's Hospital. Most of the work I have done in the past few years has been geared towards healthcare. For example, I started working at Vancouver Coastal Health in Overdose Prevention before moving to the COVID-19 response teams. At BC Children's Hospital, I am researching arthritis in children through a few different studies. However, some of my favourite job experiences were in high school working with my friends at the local baseball stadium (Nat Bailey Stadium) as caterers. The job was great because we got to spend the day in the sun watching baseball (and also working of course).

I believe good role modelling is perpetual and requires that each person in succession does their part and more for the next person. Sports really made me who I am today. As I grew up, I was fortunate to have incredible mentors that taught me fundamental lessons. For example, being a sportsman applies both on the field and off the field. My football coach refused to play players who either did not have the grades, or who were in trouble with a teacher. It didn�t matter if they were the star player or not, this was a principle that meant more to my coach than winning a game. Sports also taught me about being on a team and having camaraderie. On a football field this was blocking for your teammate, or helping them up after a play. This translates to the idea of not leaving your friends behind and standing with them through thick and thin. This has also proven to be such a valuable tenet to live by. I would love to work with a mentee that shares a similar background, but these lessons I have described are not limited to sports. I am open to learning about anyone�s experiences and hope my own will be a use to the mentee. nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047583222', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047551505', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047514156', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047589084', 0.97, 'mentor')]"

Being a pediatrician also allows you to work with children and helping them to get better makes me feel that I am bringing positive changes to their lives and making a lasting impact in helping others.  nan I went to two different secondary schools: a public school in Vancouver and a private high school in Victoria, BC. I graduated with distinction from high school and was accepted into Johns Hopkins University in the United States, which I am attending right now to pursue a bachelor's degree in molecular and cellular biology. I have been actively engaged in research in biology and currently conducting my own research project in an on-campus lab, collaborating with a post-doctoral researcher. In addition to engaging in research, I also teach online STEM classes to middle school and high school students through an education platform, where I also offer advice to students regarding their post-secondary plans and college applications. In the past year, I interned at a law firm, conducting auxiliary work in doing market research.   I enjoy listening to kpop songs during my free time. I also enjoy going to the movies with my friends. I'm also a big foodie and like to explore different restaurants and cuisines. In the winter, I like to ski even though I am very good at it as I'm not very athletic.  far from other towns/cities (like yours!) nan she/her  No preference 1 nan I'm interested in using my experiences to inspire and support younger students through times of difficulty and encourage them to challenge themselves. I recognize that secondary school is both an exciting and stressful time, with many opportunities but also uncertainties of one's ability and future. I hope I can help my mentee to balance the different aspects of their lives, answer their questions about figuring out where they want to be and discussing their post-secondary plans, as well as inspire them to think outside the box.   My family immigrated from East Asia to Vancouver when I was young. Since then, I have transferred between multiple schools and experienced a period where I felt that my cultural identity conflicted with my eagerness to fit into the new communities. I learned during high school that everyone has different beliefs, backgrounds, and opinions and I didn't need to forsake my identity to feel that I belong in the community. I would love to mentor someone who is an immigrant or international student that may need a bit more guidance to make themselves feel at ease in Canadian society. I have always been an academically oriented student since high school. I would like to mentor someone who seeks to excel in school and can use some advice with balancing course work and studying tips.     nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047551505', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047583816', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047627114', 0.98, 'mentor'), ('1047514156', 0.98, 'mentor')]"

I do not really have an interest in research or publishing papers, meaning I am not really interested in pursing a phD in order to be able to be a professor, but all the same I find my field of study fascinating and I love to learn abou it. Therefore, I would love the opportunity to travel to different parts of the country or even the world and give lectures on topics in immunology, pathology and human disease because I want others to realize the way I do how incredibly cool my field of study is. I also enjoy answering questions and seeing the understanding flash in a students' (or in my current position, one of my peers') eyes when the concept finally clicks.  nan My first two years of university immediately after high school were spent at Western University studying genetics. I chose this field because I am fascinated with human diseases, particularly those with genetic causes or links. After two years, I transferred to UBC and into the microbiology and immunology program. While I still love genetics, this program is much better suited to my interests in human pathology and disease since it encompasses genetic elements with a more focused examination of the pathogens and microorganisms that are responsible for disease. The majority of my paid work experience is in the restaurant industry as a hostess. I chose this field because I enjoy interacting with people, I am outgoing and extroverted, and enjoy multitasking and managing others. I have also been an assistant goalkeeper coach for the same youth club team I played for while I was still a current player (before my high school graduation). I chose this because I have a passion for soccer but noticed a serious lack of dedicated, quality goalkeeper training for younger children, which in my experience in necessary in order to foster development of talented goalkeepers. Additionally, female coaches are few and far between in youth soccer, and I felt strongly that in order to empower younger female players to become goalkeepers, having a female goalkeeper coach to look up to and learn from (and who is potentially less threatening than the older male coaches) would be a very valuable resource.  I have a passion for music, reading and hiking. I listen to music everyday for hours during my commute, in between classes and at home while I work. I have also been a voracious reader since I was about 8 years old. I particularly enjoy fantasy novels and/or series and have a significant collection of some of my all time favourite books in my room which I have re-read more times than I can recall. Finally, I love hiking and camping. In grade 10 I participated in the TREK outdoor education program which is an accelerated learning program that allows students to complete their grade 10 year in about half the normal time, and spend the other half of the regular school year going on hiking, kayaking and skiing trips in provincial parks across BC. We also spent a significant amount of time learning about the environments and places we were travelling to, as well as general outdoorsman etiquette, ecology, safety, first aid and risk assessment. After my grade 10 year, I took all the skills I learned and the passion I discover for the outdoors, and completed many trips including a week long hiking trip through the rockies, several multi-day trips in Garibaldi provincial park, one of which was entirely off-trial in the backcountry, as well as many smaller day trips in the Squamish and Whistler area.    far from other towns/cities (like yours!) nan she/her no preference 1 nan I hope to pass on my experiences and my advice about the transition from high school to university as it relates to how to choose the right university for yourself and what to consider when choosing.

I want to help someone who may soon be in that same position avoid the mistakes I made and come to a decision that they can feel confident in and that will bring them fulfillment and happiness in the long run. I think I would be best suited as a mentor to someone who is leaning towards pursuing some form of post secondary education (as opposed to leaving to work the family business or take an indefinite gap year for example) since that is the kind of situation in which I have the most experience and advice to provide.

1047550061,"SFU, psychology major nan I'm hoping to pursue a career as a therapist, and I honestly think I would continue doing this if grades, time, and money were not a concern! I love learning about the inner workings of people and I am passionate about helping others become the best versions of themselves. However, I think I would also moonlight as an author, as I have always loved to write but have rarely had enough time to commit to anything large-scale. I think I would write fantasy stories. nan I received my high school diploma in 2018 and attended Simon Fraser University the fall after I graduated. I applied to study psychology and loved it, so I intend to graduate with a psychology major! I find it endlessly interesting and equal parts challenging and rewarding. I didn't have a lot of time to work in high school because I was skating at a competitive level, so I got my first official job soon after starting university, which was at a toy store in Vancouver. In my spare time, I maintain a regular yoga practice, try to get out into nature frequently, and engage with stories as often as I can (especially anything pertaining to Star Wars!). I love to write when I get the chance, and I also enjoy playing video games, which I see as a wonderfully unique medium for storytelling. far from other towns/cities (like yours!) nan She/her No preference 1 nan First and foremost, I'd like to share my own experience and hopefully impact someone's life.

I also feel like I have a lot of experience with student life at this point, and I'd love to share that with anyone who can benefit from it! I can support students in confronting anxiety, balancing school with outside commitments, and learning how to navigate the post-secondary world when you're not sure how it's going to turn out. I was a student athlete and I played the violin in the school orchestra. My favourite subject was usually English (especially creative writing), and my least favourite was math, which I often struggled at.

1047516499,"University of Victoria (UVic), Health Information Science Major, Camosun College, University Transfer (Arts & Science) nan Being a ""pandemic graduate"" in 2021, my future seemed as uncertain as everything else going on in the world at that time. After taking a few months to rest and postponing my graduation travel plans, I decided to expedite the next step in my life, which was entering the ""adult world"" AKA the work force. The cycle of crafting resumes and cover letters, applying for jobs, and interviewing was humbling. However, it only made me more determined. I cast a net that would provide me the experience to get me to where I believed I could be - I first started as a Health Records Clerk and built hands-on experience to now be in my profession in Health Informatics. I always encourage my mentees to aim high, and I'm no exception. It is because of those who believed in me and the belief that I have for myself that got me to where I am today, and I'm still going! If I had to choose a specific ""dream career"", it would likely be an academic physician. I've always enjoyed teaching others what I know, and better yet, later learning from those I teach. I think it would be the ultimate privilege to help those in need, and in turn, teach the next generation from those experiences. In the end, I would love to provide free medical outreach and education to my local and rural communities, as well as around the world. How I came to choose this dream was through experiences and gratitude within the health care system that inspired me to pursue a career in medicine. It only continues to be a natural step in my path to desire a career where I could do the same for others in this field. Contrary to everyone's expectations for me, including my own, I took a gap year after high school. During this time, I worked full-time at my local grocery store to better research what college/university programs were of interest to me, were financially feasible, realistic, and academically aligned to my interests. When I eventually decided to pursue an applied science program, I began to study part-time at my local college while continuing to work - This gave me the opportunity to support my studies, family, and build transferrable credits for the future. However, life always has curve balls, doesn't it? I ended up studying a completely different program at a completely different school. But luckily for me, it all worked out. I am an example that a gap year does not mean a higher risk of not returning to post-education, and that a change of plans doesn't mean a dead-end but a re-direction; I am now graduated and working a full-time career in my field. I initially bounced from the idea of being a chemist, to a pharmacist, to a medical lab tech, and now, a doctor. If you are scared about going down the ""non-traditional route"", don't be! I'm here for ya! :)  nan Recently, I've come to the conclusion that my hobby is trying new hobbies! A combination of self-growth and life's circumstances has taught me the valuable lesson of gratitude and the finiteness of time; I'm thankful for the opportunities that enrich my existence here on Earth! With this said, my mentees will come to find that one season, I'll be taking fencing lessons, the next season, I'm signing up for ballet lessons, turn around, and I'm travelling to new countries, and just now, I'm volunteering somewhere different, and more. We're all learning about school, life, ourselves, and as a mentor, I'm no different! nan I have an urban background She/Her The most impactful characteristic a professor said I have is ""grit"". I am a very hard worker, honest, caring, and I never jeopardize my integrity. Although I am working through my perfectionism, I am striving to learn more everyday and accept ""it is what it is"". Self-growth has become an important self-concept for me! nan What I can provide for my mentee is honest guidance based from my experiences, personalized conversations to best help us connect, and a genuine desire for them to succeed. In this mentorship-relationship, I bring experiences with financing my own education (graduating debt-free), study defeat and redemption, overcoming loss, and serving as an example that as someone who has been through it, I made it across that stage, and they can too! I've worked throughout college and university with a part-time job, co-op placements, and am now employed full-time in my field. Additionally, volunteerism has gone hand-in-hand with my work - To keep this between you and me, my time volunteering as a mentor for ReMBC has been my absolute favourite!  nan I believe if any mentees personally identify with being Asian(-Canadian), and/or being introverted/shy, I would very much relate to that. I also had a very ""untraditional"" path to university, taking a gap year, part-time college studies, until I finally ended up in my university program, so pairings with students who are concerned about going directly from high school to university are welcomed. As I mentioned above, I also have experience with loss and study defeat and redemption. Significant loss impacts everyone differently, but in the end, loss was what 'woke me up' to my potential as a student, and inspired my direction towards my career now. With all being said, I will do my best to whomever I get matched with!  nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047586133', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047582077', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047631584', 0.97, 'mentor'), ('1047567831', 0.97, 'mentor')]"

Then, I could write non-fiction poetry and perform. nan I am currently studying clinical social work in UBCO�s Master of Social Work (MSW) program, but this is not where I originally planned to be at this point in my life. I went to UBCO to get a Bachelor of Science (BSc) with a Major in Psychology right after graduating from high school, wanting to eventually get a Master of Science (MSc) in Speech-Language Pathology to be a speech therapist. I have a younger sister who has Autism, and a speech therapist helped her a lot when we were younger which inspired me to help others with speech challenges. Then, I met my partner a couple years later. We got married before I graduated from my BSc, and around the same time I realized I ultimately wanted to help people with diverse abilities. While I was in school, I also worked for Disney Interactive, doing tech support, which was awesome! However, I decided to leave that for a job that was more suited to what I wanted to do before I graduated from my BSc. I became a Specialized Learning Instructor, providing one-on-one learning support for students of all ages with various mental health and learning challenges. After working at that job for about a year and a half, I had a baby and took a year to learn what being a mom was about. When my �year off� was over, I got a job as an Employment Counsellor for people with diverse abilities, so I did support work to an extent as well, helping clients find jobs and keep them if possible. Another thing that happened right after my �year off� was over was my partner encouraging me to go back to school. I always wanted to get a Master degree, and we decided it was as good a time as any. So, my life changed again, and here I am, getting a MSW while being a mom in my 20s. It�s challenging, but I have a lot of support and have had a lot of support along the way. I�m looking forward to supporting someone else through this program now too! When I have free time, I honestly like to watch comedy shows on Netflix (I�m a BIG fan of The Office, and I�m currently watching Modern Family). While I watch stuff on Netflix, I play games on my phone (Frozen Free Fall and Frozen Adventures are my favourite because I used to do technical support for them when I worked at Disney Interactive). I�m also planning on learning how to do sashiko which is Japanese embroidery. I love to sing and write non-fiction poetry when I�m in the right mood, and I also know how to play the ukulele a little bit. In high school, I played the flute in band, and growing up, I reluctantly learned how to play piano (but not very well). My favourite music to listen to is indie/folk and pop/punk. I love to do puzzles and play card games and board games too. I don�t really play console games, but my partner does a lot, as well as DnD, so I�m familiar with it all (DnD and Nintendo games in particular). As for outdoor activities and sports, I typically stick to going for walks these days, but I used to dance (ballet and jazz), play soccer, and before all of that, figure skate.

I went to Haiti for a week and a half in 2014 to meet a child I used to sponsor.  There is a range of mental health issues and disorders in my family. I have three siblings who I am close with: a brother who has ADHD, a sister who has Autism, and a sister who struggles with Anxiety and Depression. My partner and most of his family also have ADHD.  I have also worked with people of all ages with all sorts of disorders and disabilities: ADHD, FASD, PTSD, Autism (ASD), Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, Down Syndrome, Dyslexia, Visual Processing Disorder, Auditory Processing Disorder, etc.  I lived in Central Alberta (a small town called Clive) until I was 8, and then, until I was 14, my family lived in Lloydminster, Alberta/Saskatchewan. We moved houses a couple times in each place too. When I was 14, we finally moved to Kelowna, BC, where I went to high school and stayed to go to university at UBCO.

1047514156,"University of Northern British Columbia, Honours in Psychology nan My dream career is to be a clinical psychologist with my own clinic. I want to be a psychologist because I want to help individuals with different psychological disorders and mental health issues to better understand themselves. I think I had an uncommon path to post-secondary because I already had an idea of what I wanted to take as early as grade 10, and I know a lot of people do not usually know what they want to take in post-secondary. Since grade 10, I knew I had an interest in Psychology (specifically in psychological disorders and the brain-body connection). And that interested persisted until it was time to apply to university. However, I did not have the opportunity to go through the process of undergraduate application (but I have some experiences in applying to graduate school), as I was graciously offered a scholarship to UNBC due to their initiative to support students in northern BC. I went to university straight after graduating high school. I think I was lucky to continue to love Psychology as I stayed in the same program for the entirety of my undergraduate career. Through my experiences in the program, I learned about different career options and decided to pursue clinical psychology, which meant that I needed to continue into graduate school. Part of that, would also be gaining research experience to help with my graduate school application.  nan During my free time, I like playing guitar, journalling/making collages, going for walks with my blue heeler, reading, and painting (by numbers as I lack the skills to free hand...).

It is a one-of-a-kind experience, and it is a great way to get feedback for one's work. This exposure has also led me to become a research assistant for my supervisor. I was able to learn more about research techniques, work with other students on projects, and attend conferences.

One of my favourite series growing up was the Mortal Instruments by Cassandra Clare as well as the two series that followed. For TV, I binged watched many shows. In highschool, I watched Pretty Little Liars, Gossip Girl, Gilmore Girls, Suits, Brooklyn 99 and Friends. Right now, I'm looking for a new show to start watching during the summer. I also love to play video games like MarioKart or Super Smash bros.  Urban (big city) nan She/her/hers no preference 1 nan I hope to help students navigate their way through high school and college.

I have taken courses in Anthropology, Criminology, Languages, History, English, Linguistics, Psychology, Geography, Biology, and some others. I found it hard to settle on one subject.   I think it�s great to explore different possibilities and I�ve realized that it�s ok to not know what you want to do right away. Trying out different things is a great way to grow and it can actually be really helpful to have had a lot of different experiences.   I am currently a Psychology major and I hope to have a career in the future that allows me to help people.  I like playing video games, watching TV shows, movies, and YouTube videos, and reading.   The Legend of Zelda is my favourite video game series. I also like playing Animal Crossing, Cities Skylines, The Sims, and others. I like action/adventure TV shows and movies. Some of my favourites are The Avengers, Fullmetal Alchemist, Natsume�s Book of Friends, and Rocketman.  I love being active - but do not like going to the gym. I enjoy walking long distances and I often walk instead of taking the bus, even if I am going a long way. I worked at a ski hill for two seasons and I loved that I could be active at work.

Urban (big city) nan She/Her No Preference 0 nan What I've enjoyed most about mentoring is getting to know my mentees - their interests, passions, goals, etc. It's amazing being able to have such meaningful conversations with someone you've never met in person. As a mentor, I am open to chatting about anything the mentee would like to talk about whether it be about school, jobs, relationships, or debates about Netflix shows.  I have no preference to who I get matched to, but I feel like I would be helpful to students hoping to pursue a career in medicine, but that is not a priority. nan nan nan",mentor,"[('1047513315', 1.0, 'mentor'), ('1047513317', 1.0, 'mentor'), ('1047549916', 0.99, 'mentor'), ('1047555384', 0.99, 'mentor')]"
